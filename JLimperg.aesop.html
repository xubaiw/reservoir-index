<h5 data-sourcepos="44:1-44:14" dir="auto">Quickstart</h5>
<p data-sourcepos="46:1-48:8" dir="auto">To get you started, I'll explain Aesop's major concepts with a series of
examples. A more thorough, reference-style discussion of follows in the next
section.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="50:1-51:34" dir="auto">We first define our own version of lists (so as not to clash with the standard
library) and an <code>append</code> function:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-lean position-relative overflow-auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="inductive MyList (α : Type _)
  | nil
  | cons (hd : α) (tl : MyList α)

namespace MyList

  | nil, ys => ys
  | cons x xs, ys => cons x (MyList.append xs ys)

instance : Append (MyList α) :=
  ⟨MyList.append⟩"><pre><span class="pl-k">inductive</span> <span class="pl-en">MyList</span> (α : <span class="pl-k">Type</span> _)
  | nil
  | cons (hd : α) (tl : MyList α)

<span class="pl-k">instance</span> : Append (MyList α) :=
  ⟨MyList.append⟩</pre></div>
<p data-sourcepos="68:1-68:51" dir="auto">Now we define the <code>NonEmpty</code> predicate on <code>MyList</code>:</p>

  | cons : NonEmpty (cons x xs)</pre></div>
<p data-sourcepos="78:1-83:42" dir="auto">Here we see the first Aesop features. The <code>declare_aesop_rule_sets</code> command is
used to, well, declare Aesop <strong>rule sets</strong>. These are collections of <strong>rules</strong>,
which roughly correspond to tactics. When Aesop searches for a proof, it
systematically applies each available rule, then recursively searches for proofs
of the subgoals generated by the rule, and so on. A goal is proved when Aesop
applies a rule that generates no subgoals.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="85:1-85:79" dir="auto">The <strong><code>@[aesop]</code></strong> attribute adds two rules for <code>NonEmpty</code> to our new rule set:</p>
<ul data-sourcepos="87:1-91:0" dir="auto">
<li data-sourcepos="87:1-88:53">A <strong><code>constructors</code></strong> rule. This rule tries to apply each constructor of
<code>NonEmpty</code> whenever a goal has target <code>NonEmpty _</code>.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="89:1-91:0">A <strong><code>cases</code></strong> rule. This rule searches for hypotheses <code>h : NonEmpty _</code> and
performs case analysis on them (like the <code>cases</code> tactic).</li>
</ul>
<p data-sourcepos="92:1-93:46" dir="auto"><code>constructors</code> and <code>cases</code> are examples of <strong>rule builders</strong>, which are
functions that turn a declaration into a rule.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="95:1-98:56" dir="auto">Both rules above are added as <strong>safe</strong> rules. When a safe rule succeeds on a
goal encountered during the proof search, it is applied and the goal is never
revisited thereafter. In other words, the search does not backtrack safe rules.
We will later see <strong>unsafe</strong> rules, which can backtrack.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="100:1-100:71" dir="auto">With these rules, we can prove a theorem about <code>NonEmpty</code> and <code>append</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-lean position-relative overflow-auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="@[aesop safe apply]
theorem nonEmpty_append {xs : MyList α} ys :
    NonEmpty xs → NonEmpty (xs ++ ys) := by
  aesop (rule_sets [MyList.NonEmpty])"><pre><span class="pl-k">@[aesop safe apply]</span>
<span class="pl-k">theorem</span> <span class="pl-en">nonEmpty_append</span> {xs : MyList α} ys :
    NonEmpty xs → NonEmpty (xs ++ ys) := <span class="pl-k">by</span>
  aesop (rule_sets [MyList.NonEmpty])</pre></div>
<p data-sourcepos="109:1-112:45" dir="auto">Here we call Aesop with the <code>MyList.NonEmpty</code> rule set, plus some default rule
sets which are implicitly enabled (but can be disabled). Aesop finds a proof by
introducing the hypothesis <code>h : NonEmpty xs</code>, performing case analysis on <code>h</code>
and applying the <code>NonEmpty.cons</code> constructor.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="114:1-115:75" dir="auto">If you want to see how Aesop proves your goal (or more likely, why it doesn't
prove your goal or why it takes too long to do so), you can enable tracing:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-lean position-relative overflow-auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="set_option trace.aesop.steps true"><pre><span class="pl-k">set_option</span> trace.aesop.steps true</pre></div>
<p data-sourcepos="121:1-123:25" dir="auto">This makes Aesop print out the steps it takes while searching for a proof. There
are also other tracing options which autocompletion should show you if you type
<code>set_option trace.aesop</code>.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="125:1-128:29" dir="auto">The <code>@[aesop]</code> attribute on <code>nonEmpty_append</code> adds this lemma as a safe rule to
the default rule set. For this rule we use the <strong><code>apply</code></strong> rule builder, which
generates a rule that tries to apply <code>nonEmpty_append</code> whenever the target is of
the form <code>NonEmpty (_ ++ _)</code>.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="130:1-130:79" dir="auto">After adding <code>nonEmpty_append</code>, Aesop can now prove consequences of this lemma:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-lean position-relative overflow-auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="example {α : Type u} {xs : MyList α} ys zs :
    NonEmpty xs → NonEmpty (xs ++ ys ++ zs) := by
  aesop"><pre><span class="pl-k">example</span> {α : <span class="pl-k">Type</span> u} {xs : MyList α} ys zs :
    NonEmpty xs → NonEmpty (xs ++ ys ++ zs) := <span class="pl-k">by</span>
  aesop</pre></div>
<p data-sourcepos="138:1-138:55" dir="auto">Next, we prove another simple theorem about <code>NonEmpty</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-lean position-relative overflow-auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="theorem nil_not_NonEmpty (xs : MyList α) : xs = nil → ¬ NonEmpty xs := by
  aesop (add unsafe 10% cases MyList, norm unfold Not)
    (rule_sets [MyList.NonEmpty])"><pre><span class="pl-k">theorem</span> <span class="pl-en">nil_not_NonEmpty</span> (xs : MyList α) : xs = nil → ¬ NonEmpty xs := <span class="pl-k">by</span>
  aesop (add unsafe <span class="pl-c1">10</span>% cases MyList, norm unfold Not)
    (rule_sets [MyList.NonEmpty])</pre></div>
<p data-sourcepos="146:1-148:9" dir="auto">Here, we add two rules in an <strong><code>add</code></strong> clause. These rules are not part of a
rule set but are added for this Aesop call only. They demonstrate two new
features:</p>
<ul data-sourcepos="150:1-176:0" dir="auto">
<li data-sourcepos="150:1-168:0">
<p data-sourcepos="150:3-157:16" dir="auto"><strong>Unsafe</strong> rules are rules which can backtrack. Here we add <code>cases MyList</code> as
an unsafe rule because when we perform <code>cases</code> on a hypothesis <code>xs : MyList α</code>, we get <code>hd : α</code> and <code>tl : MyList α</code>. If the rule was safe, we could easily
get into an infinite loop where we call <code>cases</code> on <code>tl</code> again, and so on.
Unsafe rules, by contrast, are applied 'in parallel', so while we might still
end up exploring a proof attempt that performs <code>cases</code> 20 times, other
possible rules will also be considered and will hopefully lead us down a more
fruitful path.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="159:3-167:72" dir="auto">To prioritise these different proof attempts, every unsafe rules is annotated
with a <strong>success probability</strong>, here 10%. This should be an estimate of how
likely it is that the rule will to lead to a successful proof. This estimate
is used to prioritise goals: the initial goal starts with a priority of 100%
and whenever we apply an unsafe rule, the priority of its subgoals is the
priority of its parent goal times the success probability of the applied rule.
So applying our <code>cases MyList</code> rule repeatedly would give us goals with
priority 10%, 1%, 0.1% etc. Of course, the success probability of a rule is
only a ballpark figure; it is not supposed to be precise in any sense.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="169:1-176:0">
<p data-sourcepos="169:3-175:8" dir="auto"><strong>Norm</strong> rules are yet another class of rules. They are used to normalise the
goal before any other rules are applied. As part of this normalisation
process, we run a variant of <code>simp_all</code> with the global <code>simp</code> set plus
Aesop-specific simp lemmas. The <strong><code>unfold</code></strong> builder adds such an
Aesop-specific simp lemma which unfolds the <code>Not</code> definition. (This is only
necessary because the builtin rules currently do not handle negation very
well.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-sourcepos="177:1-177:64" dir="auto">Here are some other examples where normalisation comes in handy:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-lean position-relative overflow-auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="@[aesop norm]

<p data-sourcepos="196:1-202:11" dir="auto">After we've added unfolding lemmas for <code>append</code>, Aesop can prove theorems about
this function more or less by itself. (For these examples, <code>simp</code> would already
suffice.) However, we still need to perform induction explicitly. This is a
deliberate design choice: while there are some techniques for automating
induction, they are complex and not entirely reliable, so I don't think it makes
sense to implement them in a system where users can easily perform induction
themselves.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="204:1-204:68" dir="auto">More examples may be found in the <code>tests</code> folder of this repository.</p>
<h5 data-sourcepos="206:1-206:13" dir="auto">Reference</h5>
<p data-sourcepos="208:1-209:9" dir="auto">This section contains a systematic and fairly comprehensive account of how Aesop
operates.</p>
<h6 data-sourcepos="211:1-211:10" dir="auto">Rules</h6>
<p data-sourcepos="213:1-213:79" dir="auto">A rule is a tactic plus some associated metadata. Rules come in three flavours:</p>
<ul data-sourcepos="215:1-248:0" dir="auto">
<li data-sourcepos="215:1-224:0">
<p data-sourcepos="215:3-219:49" dir="auto"><strong>Normalisation rules</strong> (keyword <code>norm</code>) must generate zero or one subgoal.
(Zero means that the rule closed the goal). They must not fail. Each
normalisation rule is associated with an integer <strong>penalty</strong> (default 1).
Normalisation rules are applied in order of penalty, lowest first. For rules
with equal penalties, the order is unspecified.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="221:3-223:39" dir="auto">Normalisation rules can also be simp lemmas. These are constructed with the
<code>unfold</code> or <code>simp</code> builder. They are used by a special <code>simp</code> call during
the normalisation process; see below.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="225:1-235:0">
<p data-sourcepos="225:3-229:58" dir="auto"><strong>Safe rules</strong> (keyword <code>safe</code>) are applied after normalisation but before any
unsafe rules. When a safe rule is successfully applied to a goal, the goal
becomes <em>inactive</em>, meaning no other rules are considered for it. Like
normalisation rules, safe rules are associated with a penalty (default 1)
which determines the order in which the rules are tried.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="231:3-234:56" dir="auto">Safe rules should be provability-preserving, meaning that if a goal is
provable and we apply a safe rule to it, the generated subgoals should still
be provable. This is a less precise notion than it may appear since
what is provable depends on the entire Aesop rule set.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="236:1-248:0">
<p data-sourcepos="236:3-241:45" dir="auto"><strong>Unsafe rules</strong> (keyword <code>unsafe</code>) are tried only if all available safe rules
have failed on a goal. When an unsafe rule is applied to a goal, the goal is
not marked as inactive, so other (unsafe) rules may be applied to it. These
rule applications are considered independently until one of them proves the
goal (or until we've exhausted all available rules and determine that the goal
is not provable with the current rule set).</p>
<p data-sourcepos="243:3-247:73" dir="auto">Each unsafe rule has a <strong>success probability</strong> between 0% and 100%. These
probabilities are used to determine the priority of a goal. The initial goal
has priority 100% and whenever we apply an unsafe rule, the priorities of its
subgoals are the priority of the rule's parent goal times the rule's success
probability. Safe rules are treated as having 100% success probability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-sourcepos="249:1-253:67" dir="auto">Rules can also be <strong>multi-rules</strong>. These are rules which 'nondeterministically'
apply multiple tactics to the goal. Each of these tactics is then considered as
one possible way to solve the goal. For example, registering the constructors of
the <code>Or</code> type will generate a multi-rule that, given a goal with target <code>A ∨ B</code>,
generates one rule application with goal <code>A</code> and one with goal <code>B</code>.</p>
<h6 data-sourcepos="255:1-255:16" dir="auto">Search Tree</h6>
<p data-sourcepos="257:1-258:19" dir="auto">Aesop's central data structure is a search tree. This tree alternates between
two kinds of nodes:</p>
<ul data-sourcepos="260:1-268:0" dir="auto">
<li data-sourcepos="260:1-262:68"><strong>Goal nodes</strong>: these nodes store a goal, plus metadata relevant to the
search. The parent and children of a goal node are rule application nodes. In
particular, each goal node has a <strong>priority</strong> between 0% and 100%.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="263:1-268:0"><strong>Rule application ('rapp') nodes</strong>: these goals store a rule (plus metadata).
The parent and children of a rapp node are goal nodes. When the search tree
contains a rapp node with rule <code>r</code>, parent <code>p</code> and children <code>c₁, ..., cₙ</code>,
this means that the tactic of rule <code>r</code> was applied to the goal of <code>p</code>,
generating the subgoals of the <code>cᵢ</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p data-sourcepos="269:1-271:79" dir="auto">When a goal node has multiple child rapp nodes, we have a choice of how to solve
the goals. This makes the tree an AND-OR tree: to prove a rapp, <em>all</em> its child
goals must be proved; to prove a goal, <em>any</em> of its child rapps must be proved.</p>
<h6 data-sourcepos="273:1-273:11" dir="auto">Search</h6>
<p data-sourcepos="275:1-280:14" dir="auto">We start with a search tree containing a single goal node. This node's goal is
the goal which Aesop is supposed to solve. Then we perform the following steps
in a loop, stopping if (a) the root goal has been proved; (b) the root goal
becomes unprovable; or (c) one of Aesop's rule limits has been reached. (There
are configurable limits on, e.g., the total number of rules applied or the
search depth.)</p>
<ul data-sourcepos="282:1-303:0" dir="auto">
<li data-sourcepos="282:1-284:5">
<p data-sourcepos="282:3-284:5" dir="auto">Pick the highest-priority active goal node <code>G</code>. Roughly speaking, a goal node
is active if it is not proved and we haven't yet applied all possible rules to
it.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="285:1-293:12">
<p data-sourcepos="285:3-285:75" dir="auto">If the goal of <code>G</code> has not been normalised yet, normalise it. That means:</p>
<ul data-sourcepos="287:3-291:0" dir="auto">
<li data-sourcepos="287:3-287:77">Run all normalisation rules with negative penalty (lowest penalty first).</li>
<li data-sourcepos="288:3-288:78">Run <code>simp</code> with the global simp set plus Aesop's normalisation simp rules.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="289:3-291:0">Run all normalisation rules with non-negative penalty (lowest penalty
first).</li>
</ul>
<p data-sourcepos="292:3-293:12" dir="auto">This process destructively updates the goal of <code>G</code>. (It may also prove it
outright.)</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="294:1-297:51">
<p data-sourcepos="294:3-297:51" dir="auto">If we haven't tried to apply the safe rules to the goal of <code>G</code> yet, try to
apply each safe rule (lowest penalty first). As soon as a rule succeeds, add
the corresponding rapp and child goals to the tree and mark <code>G</code> as inactive.
The child goals receive the same priority as <code>G</code>.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="298:1-303:0">
<p data-sourcepos="298:3-302:42" dir="auto">Otherwise there is at least one unsafe rule that hasn't been tried on <code>G</code> yet
(or else <code>G</code> would have been inactive). Try the unsafe rule with the highest
success probability and if it succeeds, add the corresponding rapp and child
goals to the tree. The child goals receive the priority of <code>G</code> times the
success probability of the applied rule.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-sourcepos="304:1-306:23" dir="auto">A goal is unprovable if we have applied all possible rules to it and all
resulting child rapps are unprovable. A rapp is unprovable if any of its
subgoals is unprovable.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="308:1-310:72" dir="auto">During the search, a goal or rapp can also become irrelevant, meaning its
provability has no impact on the success of the overall proof search.
More formally, irrelevance is characterised by the following conditions:</p>
<ul data-sourcepos="312:1-318:0" dir="auto">
<li data-sourcepos="312:1-314:40">A goal is irrelevant if its parent rapp is unprovable. (This means that a
sibling of the goal is already unprovable, in which case we already know that
the parent rapp will never be proved.)</li>
<li data-sourcepos="315:1-316:61">A rapp is irrelevant if its parent goal is proved. (This means that a sibling
of the rapp is already proved, and we only need one proof.)</li>
<li data-sourcepos="317:1-318:0">A goal or rapp is irrelevant if any of its ancestors is irrelevant.</li>
</ul>
<h6 data-sourcepos="319:1-319:18" dir="auto">Rule Builders</h6>
<p data-sourcepos="321:1-322:48" dir="auto">A <strong>rule builder</strong> is a metaprogram that turns a declaration or hypothesis into
an Aesop rule. Currently available builders are:</p>
<ul data-sourcepos="324:1-435:0" dir="auto">
<li data-sourcepos="324:1-325:72">
<p data-sourcepos="324:3-325:72" dir="auto"><strong><code>apply</code></strong>: generates a rule which tries to apply the given declaration or

<p data-sourcepos="326:3-329:44" dir="auto"><strong><code>forward</code></strong>: when applied to a declaration or hypothesis of type <code>A₁ → ... Aₙ → B</code>, generates a rule which looks for hypotheses <code>h₁ : A₁</code>, ..., <code>hₙ : Aₙ</code>

example, consider the lemma <code>even_or_odd</code>:</p>

hypothesis is duplicated to ensure that it will remain available regardless of
which other rules are applied to the goal. E.g. when you have a hypothesis <code>h : A ∧ B</code> which you register as an <code>apply</code> rule, and you also have a <code>cases</code> rule
for <code>And</code>, we want to make sure that <code>h</code> is not destroyed by the <code>cases</code> rule.
To do this, we create a new hypothesis <code>_local.h : A ∧ B</code> and register that
hypothesis as an <code>apply</code> rule. We also mark <code>_local.h</code> as an <code>auxDecl</code> to make
sure that most tactics will ignore it; e.g. it will not be found by
