## Contributing

The markdown files are generated automatically via [lean2md](https://github.com/arthurpaulino/lean2md).
Thus, if you're going to write or fix content for the book, please do so in the original Lean files inside the [lean](lean) directory.

**Important**: since `lean2md` is so simple, please avoid using comment sections
in Lean code blocks with `/- ... -/`. If you want to insert commentaries, do so
with double dashes `--`.

To open the PR, select `dev` as the target branch.

### Building the markdown files

This is not required, but if you want to build the markdown files, you can do so by running `lake run build`.
It requires having Python installed, as well as the `lean2md` package.

Or, if you have [viper](https://github.com/arthurpaulino/viper) installed and a linked environment that has `lean2md`, you can call `lake run viper_build`.
