## Smart constructors for expressions

Lean has smart helpers that allow construction of expressions with hygeine,
reduction and other such details taken care of the system, and allow us to use
the powerful unifier. Here we sketch a few of these.

But first, let's recap the definition of `natExpr`

```lean
open Lean Meta

def natExpr : Nat → Expr
  | 0     => mkConst ``Nat.zero
  | n + 1 => mkApp (mkConst ``Nat.succ) (natExpr n)

#eval natExpr 1
-- Lean.Expr.app
--   (Lean.Expr.const `Nat.succ [] (Expr.mkData 3403344051 (bi := Lean.BinderInfo.default)))
--   (Lean.Expr.const `Nat.zero [] (Expr.mkData 3114957063 (bi := Lean.BinderInfo.default)))
--   (Expr.mkData 3354277877 (approxDepth := 1) (bi := Lean.BinderInfo.default))
```

That's already a long expression for the natural number 1! Let's see what
`reduce : Expr → MetaM Expr` can do about it

```lean
#eval reduce $ natExpr 1
-- Lean.Expr.lit (Lean.Literal.natVal 1) (Expr.mkData 4289331193 (bi := Lean.BinderInfo.default))
```

The following example would yield an even longer expression, but `reduce`
can clean it up for us:

```lean
def sumExprM (n m : Nat) : MetaM Expr := do
  reduce $ mkAppN (mkConst ``Nat.add) #[natExpr n, natExpr m]

#eval sumExprM 2 3 --Lean.Expr.lit (Lean.Literal.natVal 5) (Expr.mkData 1441793 (bi := Lean.BinderInfo.default))
```

We next construct a λ-expression for the function `double : Nat → Nat` given
by `double n = n + n`. To construct such an expression, a free variable `n` has
to be introduced, the expression defined in terms of this variable, and the
λ-expression should be constructed. 

The variable is introduced by passing the code using it as a _continuation_ to 
`withLocalDecl`. The arguments of `withLocalDecl` are:
* The name of the variable
* The _binder_ that determines whether it is explicit or not
* The type of the variable
* The function that turns an expression into something else (in our case, into
  another expression). This function does not need to be pure.

The λ-expression is constructed using `mkLambdaFVars`, with the first argument
being an array of free variables (just one in this case) with respect to which
we take λ. The second argument is the body of the λ-expression.

```lean
def doubleM : MetaM Expr :=
  withLocalDecl `n BinderInfo.default (mkConst ``Nat)
    fun n : Expr => mkLambdaFVars #[n] $ mkAppN (mkConst ``Nat.add) #[n, n]
```

Let's check if `doubleM` can indeed compute the expression for `n + n`

```lean
def appDoubleM (n : Nat) : MetaM Expr := do
  reduce $ mkApp (← doubleM) (natExpr n)

#eval appDoubleM 3 -- Lean.Expr.lit (Lean.Literal.natVal 6) (Expr.mkData 393219 (bi := Lean.BinderInfo.default))
```

A powerful feature of lean is its unifier. There is an easy way to use this
while meta-programming, namely the method `mkAppM` (and a similar method
`mkAppM'`). For example, we can construct an expression for the length of a list
using `mkAppM`. Recall that `List.length` has an implicit parameter
`α : Type u`. This is deduced by unification, as are universe levels.

```lean
def lenExprM (list: Expr) : MetaM Expr := do
  reduce $ ← mkAppM ``List.length #[list]
```

We test the unification in this definition.

```lean
def egList := [1, 3, 7, 8]

def egLenM : MetaM Expr := 
  lenExprM (mkConst ``egList)

#eval egLenM -- Lean.Expr.lit (Lean.Literal.natVal 4) (Expr.mkData 2490367 (bi := Lean.BinderInfo.default))
```

Analogous to the construction of λ-expressions, we can construct
∀-expressions (i.e., Π-expressions) for types. We simply replace
`mkLambdaFVars` with `mkForallFVars`.

A special case of Π-types are function types `A → B`. These can be constructed
using the function `mkArrow`. Another very useful meta-level function is `mkEq`,
which constructs equalities.

We illustrate all these, as well as the construction of a λ-expressions, by
constructing the proposition `∀ n: Nat, f n = f (n + 1)` as a function of `f`.
Formally this is `λ f, ∀ n, f n = f (n + 1)`. We break this into many steps to
illustrate the different ingredients.

First we build the expression for our proposition:

```lean
def propM : MetaM Expr := do
  let funcType ← mkArrow (mkConst ``Nat) (mkConst ``Nat)
  withLocalDecl `f BinderInfo.default funcType fun f => do
  let feqn ← withLocalDecl `n BinderInfo.default (mkConst ``Nat) fun n => do
    let lhs := mkApp f n
    let rhs := mkApp f (← mkAppM ``Nat.succ #[n])
    let eqn ← mkEq lhs rhs
    mkForallFVars #[n] eqn
  mkLambdaFVars #[f] feqn
```

Now let's elaborate the expression into a term so we can see the result of
what we did more easily. This will be further explored in the next chapter

```lean
elab "myProp" : term => propM

#check  myProp -- fun f => ∀ (n : Nat), f n = f (Nat.succ n) : (Nat → Nat) → Prop
#reduce myProp -- fun f => ∀ (n : Nat), f n = f (Nat.succ n)
#reduce myProp Nat.succ -- ∀ (n : Nat), Nat.succ n = Nat.succ (Nat.succ n)
```
