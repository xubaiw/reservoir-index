Metabelian groups are group extensions `1 → K → G → Q → 1` with both the kernel and the quotient abelian. Such an extension is determined by data:

* a group action of `Q` on `K`
* a cocyle `c: Q → Q → K`

We have to define the cocycle condition and construct a group structure on a structure extending `K × Q`. The main step is to show that the cocyle condition implies associativity.
