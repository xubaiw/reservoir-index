This file contains a proof that the group `P` defined is in fact torsion-free.
 .
Roughly, the steps are as follows (further details can be found in the corresponding `.md` file):
1. Define a function `s : Q -> K -> K` taking a group element `(q, k)` to its square `(s q k, 0)`. This element lies in the kernel as the group `ℤ₂ × ℤ₂` is annihilated by `2`.
2. Show that elements of the form `((a, b, c), (0, 0))` do not have torsion. This argument requires proving (something very close to) the fact that `ℤ` is an integral domain.
3. Show that no element of `P` has order precisely `2`. This is an argument by cases on the `Q` part of elements of `P`.
4. Finally, if an element `g : P` is in the kernel of the `n`-th power homomorphism, then so is `g^2`. But from the above statements, we see that `g^2` is of the form `(k, 0)` and hence
   either `g^2 = e` or `n = 0` (as elements of this form cannot have torsion). If `g^2 = e`, then `g = e` as `P` does not contain any order `2` elements. Otherwise, `n = 0`.
5. Together, this shows that `P` is torsion-free.
