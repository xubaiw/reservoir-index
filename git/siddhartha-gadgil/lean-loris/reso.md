This is in addition to my comments on the previous material.

The article has interesting material, but is still very long though changes have been made in the light of my previous comments, . This is both an issue in terms of pages taken up and the waning attention of the reader.

It is up to the editors judgement whether an article this lond, and hence with an "interest density" lower than many expository articles, should be published in resonance.
