* induction

** you need a base case (ok: 1 simplex)
** something has to shrink down to the base case
in our case, we're inducting on the number of faces



* tverberg's triangulation

any convex polytope K can be dissected into finitely many simplices in the way described above.

lemma tv1:
  assumes "convex-polytope K"
      and "~ is_simplex K"
  obtains F1 F2 V
    where p: "V vertex_of K"
      and f1: "F1 facet_of K" and vf1: "V ~: F1"
      and f2: "F2 facet_of K" and vf2: "V ~: F2"
proof -
  fix F assume "F facet_of K"
  then show ?thesis proof (cases "is_simplex F")
    case False
    then obtain "V vertex_of F"
                "FF1 facet_of F" and  "V ~: FF1"
                "FF2 facet_of F" and  "V ~: FF2"
    then obtain F1 F2 by extending FF1 FF2 into faces of K where FF1 ~= F and FF2 ~=F
    thus ?thesis .
  next
    case True ("is_simplex F")
      obtain F2 where "F2 facet_of K" and "F2 adjoins F"
      with `~ is_simplex K` have "?V:K. V~:F & V~:F2" proof (ccontr)
        assume "!V:K. V~:F | V ~:F2"
        thus "is_simplex K" by magic
      qed
    thus ?thesis .

lemma tv2:
  assumes "d simplex s" and "h cut s = {a,b}"
      and "d simplex a | d simplex b"
   obtains f where "f face_of a & f face_of b & (d-1) simplex f"
\<^proof>

theorem tverberg-dissect:
  assumes "convex-polytope K"
  obtains T where "T triangulates K"
proof (induction f)  // number of facets
  if f < 4 then K is already a simplex
  else let D = aff-dim K
    then show thesis by cases
      case 1: "K has a vertex P where more than D facets meet"
        have H separating P from other vertices of K
        hence intersection HK of of H and K
          and HK is a (d-1)-polytope
          and HK is not a simplex
          and HK has fewer facets than K
        hence dissection of HKD HK by cuts in H (by induction hypothesis)
        then for each d-2 hyperplane in HKD, extend to the d-1 hyperplane through P
        then obtain a dissection of K into polytopes K0..Kn
          for each Ki in K0..Kn:
            Ki is a (d) polytope
            Ki has fewer facets than K
        hence we can break it down recursively
    next
      case 2: "At each vertex of K only d facets meet"
        using tv1 obtain F1 F2 P
        let H1 = affine hull F1
        let H2 = affine hull F2
        let H = hyperplane through P containing intersection of H1 H2 (possibly at infinity)
        then obtain K1 K2 where
           "F1 facet_of K1" and "Fi is a facet of Ki, not containing any facet of K[3-i] (i=1,2)."
        hence "card facets K1 <= card facets K"
          and "card facets K2 <= card facets K"
        proof
          let ?Ki = k1 (then k2) and Kj = the other one
          let m = number of facets of Ki that that meet at p
          consider (2a) m>d | (2b) m=d
          hence Ki can be dissected as desired proof (cases)
            case 2a then have m > d
              (dissect as desired by case 1)
            case 2b then have (m=d)
              obtain vertex figure of K at P to conclude that one of the facets of K through P (say F3) becomes a facet of Kj
              thus F1 and F3 contain no facet of Ki
              moreover only one facet of Ki (the one in H) is not contained in some facet of K
              hence Ki has fewer facets than K

* triangulation
I have two arguments I want to make that both involve induction
over a triangulation of a polytope:

1. I'm attempting to prove the generalized Euler relation,
   which says that for an n-dimensional polytope p:

   (SUM k=0..n. (-1)^k * (count of k-dimensional faces of p)) = 0

   I've shown this holds for all n-dimensional simplices,
   and since the empty set, a point, and a line segment are all
   simplices, I've shown that it holds for all polytopes of
   dimension <= 1.

   I want to show by induction that if the relation holds for
   dimensions 0..n-1, then it holds for dimension n.

   To do this, I plan to follow Tverberg [1] and demonstrate that
   if a polytope is cut into two pieces by a hyperplane, and the
   relation holds for those two pieces, then it also holds for the
   polytope.

   So finally, I want to demonstrate by induction that I can cut
   the polytope into simplices. The final cut divides the poltope
   into two simplices, and the relation holds for  
   

since I can cut the poylgon into simplices, then by induction,
   the relation holds at each step along the way.

* Goal:
Demonstrate that we can use Isabelle to understand and prove 3 introductory theorems.


* outline of the paper
** [0/1] definitions:
- [ ] convex :: a set of points is convex when for any two members x and y in the set, every point anywhere between them is also in the set.
- [ ] hull :: the p hull of set s is the intersection of all sets that both satisfy predicate p and contain s
- [ ] polytope :: a convex hull of some finite set of vertices
- [ ] affine :: said of vectors that occupy the same hyperplane
- [ ] affine dependent :: said of a set where at least one point lies on the affine hull of another point.
- [ ] bounded :: satisfying a system of linear inequalities
- [ ] polyhedron :: the intersection of a finite set of faces F, such that each face is a hyperplane.

in addition, this definition requires that there is a vector a such that for any x, the inner product of a and x is less than or equal to b...
# which means what?!? coxeter says something similar about the faces not "penetrating the interior"
- [ ] polytope ::  a bounded polyhedron
- [ ] hyperlane :: separates an N-dimensional space into 2 (N-1)-dimensional regions. Eg: a line separates the plane into two half-planes, a plane separates space into two half-spaces.

- [ ] inner product of a and b :: a number that means something like the angle between two vectors a and b
- [ ] simplex :: an n-simplex is the convex hull of n+1 affine-independent vectors.
For example, a triangle is a 2-simplex: it has 3 sides (facets),
- [ ] regular n-polytope :: each facet is the same regular (n-1) polytope, and the same number of facets meet at each (n-2 face)

**** 1. Edge Theorem
#+begin_quote
Given a simple polygon, form a complete triangularization to obtain a figure that will be a plane graph. The number of edges is given by ~E = 3 I + 2B - 3~ where ~E~ is the number of edges, ~B~ is the number of boundary vertices, and ~I~ is the number of interior vertices.

proof:

i. If B=3, I=0, then E=3 (a triangle with no interior vertices)
ii. If a new interior vertex is inserted, E is increased by 3.
iii. If a new boundary vertex is added which results in x old boundary vertices becoming interior vertices (note: x may be zero) it is obvious that E is increased by 2+x. Here we have:

~E + 2 + x = 3(I + x) + 2(B + 1 - x) - 3~
or

~E = 3I + 2B - 3~
#+end_quote


**** Area of the triangle
**** 2. (Euler's formula): V - E + F = 2
**** 3. Derivation of Pick's formula:

: V = I + B   (interior and exterior vertices)
: E = 3I + 2B - 3

: (F - 1)/ 2 = A  (area of polygon)
I'm not sure how to prove this one yet.
Presumably the (F-1) is because one of the faces in the infinite exterior face... Each vertex lies on the lattice and no face (triangle) has any interior points of its own.

Anyway, then we plug those into Euler:

: V - E + F = 2
: (I + B) - E + F = 2
: (I + B) - (3I + 2B -3) + F = 2
: -2I -1B +3 + F = 2
: F = 2I + B - 1
: F-1 = 2I + B - 2)
: (F-1)/2 = I + (B/2) -1
: A = I + B/2 -1


* TODO Simplical Complex == Planar Graph
Just saw this tonight, but I don't remember where.
Coxeter's book?







* question: card (d_faces (simplex n))

I'm stuck.

My goal is to count the number of k-dimensional faces of an n-dimensional simplex.

I've proven that:

  1. an n-dimensional simplex has n+1 vertices.
  2. a face of a simplex is a simplex
  3. the convex hull of any subset of the vertices of simplex S is a face of S

=Binomial.n_subsets= gives me the that there are therefore (n+1

It should be easy enough to show that there are therefore (n+1 choose k+1)


* question : how to prove that F corresponding-face C == C corresponding-corners F?

- really: how to prove a bijection
bijective = injective and surjective
injective = f x = f y --> x = y
surjective = !y. ?x. f x = y






* problems encountered

** getting arithmetic to work out for sum of n-choose k

- problem is the empty set, which has d = -1, and wanting to use that in a formula that only takes nats.


- so instead define c where c = size of the subset:
  - n-simplex has k=n+1 vertices
  - d-simplex -1<= d <=n has c=d+1 vertices


now we can sum:

   eulerchar s = sum(c=0..k) -1^c * (c-1 dFaceCount S)
