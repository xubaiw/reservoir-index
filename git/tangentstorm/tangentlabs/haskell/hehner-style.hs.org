* Programs as Boolean Expressions

A key insight in Eric Hehner's /Practical Theory of Programming/ is that both programs and specifications can be treated as boolean expressions.

Although he spends the first part of the book building up a unified theory of basic objects such as numbers, characters, lists, and sets, the actual language he creates consists only of statements /about/ those objects.

* The empty program

In Hehner's notation, the equal sign (=\equal=) represents a test for equality (rather than assignment), =σ= represents the state of the entire system before the program starts, and =σ′= represents the state when the program ends.

Therefore, the following line specifies a program that has no effect.

#+begin_src text
σ = σ′
#+end_src

This specification is also the smallest possible program, and it is used so often that Hehner gives it a special syntax: the keyword =ok=.

* Language tools.

Now that we have our first program, it would be nice if we had an /interpreter/ to run it, and a /proof checker/ to make sure that it's implemented correctly.

Since our program doesn't have to do anything, both of these tools will be pretty simple. That's fine, though: it gives us a chance to figure out how the whole system fits together.
