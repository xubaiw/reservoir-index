         The ITE Graph (ITEG) Format Version 20210405
        ----------------------------------------------
 	 Randal E. Bryant, Carnegie Mellon University

This report describes the ITEG file format for representing
combinational logic circuits using the If-Then-Else (ITE) logic
primitive.

The ITE operator is can defined in several ways:
     ITE(a,b,c) = (a & b) | (!a & c)
     		= (a --> b) & (!a --> c)
		= (!a | b) & (a | c)

Together with constant values 0 and 1, it can directly encode a number
of standard logic operations:

     AND(a,b)    = ITE(a,b,0)
      OR(a,b)    = ITE(a,1,b)
     NOT(a)      = ITE(a,0,1)
     IMPLY(a,b)  = ITE(a,b,1)

It also serves as a way to directly translate a Binary Decision
Diagram (BDD) into a circuit, with each node represented by an ITE
operation.

The ITEG file format is an ASCII, line-oriented format with the fields
being separated by whitespace characters.

Lines that begin with the character 'c' are considered to be comments
and can be ignored.

The file uses nonnegative integer indices as follows:

0         False
1         True
2   - M   Inputs
M+2 - M+N ITE Operators

The file consists of the following:
    HEADER
    INPUT DECLARATIONS
    OUTPUT DECLARATIONS
    ITE OPERATIONS

HEADER
  The header for an ITE file consists of the following:

     iteg M I O N

  interpreted as:

     M = maximum variable index (allows sparse numbering of inputs)
     I = number of inputs (typically M = I+1)
     O = number of outputs
     N = number of ITE operators

INPUT DECLARATIONS

  The input declarations list the input indices in ascending order, each on a separate line

OUTPUT DECLARATIONS

  The output declarations list the output indices, each on a separate
  line.  Each of these can be the index of a constant, an input, or an
  ITE operation.  The indices need not be consecutive.

ITE OPERATIONS

  Each ITE operation is listed on a separate line, with four indices

    O I T E  

  with O being the index of the operation, and I, T, and E being the
  indices of the three arguments.  The operations must be listed in
  order and numbered consecutively.  The I, T, and E indices must all be
  less than O.

EXAMPLES

  An inverter:

    iteg 2 1 1 1
    c Input a
    2
    c Output
    3
    c ITE(a, 0, 1)
    3 2 0 1

  Xor(a,b)

    iteg 3 2 1 2
    c Inputs a, b
    2
    3
    c Output
    5
    c !b = ITE(b, 0, 1)
    4 3 0 1
    c a^b = ITE(a, !b, b)
    5 2 4 3
