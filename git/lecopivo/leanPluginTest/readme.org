To build and run:

#+begin_src
lake build
cd build; mkdir debug; cd debug
cmake ../..
make -j
./main
./main2
#+end_src

Quick rebuild command from =build/debug= directory
#+begin_src
pushd ../../; lake build; popd; make -j
#+end_src

Potentially set up =LD_LIBRARY_PATH= to have =libleanshared.so= available
#+begin_src
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/.elan/toolchains/leanprover--lean4---nightly/lib/lean
#+end_src
