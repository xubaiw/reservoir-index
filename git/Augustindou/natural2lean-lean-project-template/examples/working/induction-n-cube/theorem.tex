% theorem statement
For any natural number $n$, $n^3 + 2n$ is divisible by $3$.

% proof
We will use induction on $n$.

The base case, $n = 0$, is trivial.

For $n = k+1$, the induction hypothesis gives us that $k^3 + 2k$ is divisible by $3$.

Therefore, we have a natural number $z$ such that $k^3 + 2k = 3*z$.

By expansion, we can derive $(k+1)^3 + 2(k+1) = k^3 + 3k^2 + 5k + 3 = k^3 + 2k + 3(k^2 + k + 1) =3z + 3(k^2 + k + 1) = 3(z+k^2+k+1)$.

Hence, $(k+1)^3 + 2(k+1)$ is divisible by $3$, therefore $n^3 + 2n$ is divisible by $3$.
