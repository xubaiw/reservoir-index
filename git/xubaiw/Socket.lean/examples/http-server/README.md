# HTTP Server Example

This examples shows how to build a HTTP server with Lean, which listens to <http://localhost:8080>. 

To run this example, switch to the `example/http-server` folder, build and run.

```sh
$ cd examples/http-server
$ lake build
$ ./build/bin/http-server
```

Now you can open <http://localhost:8080> in your browser and check the response.
