# Lean4-Socket

A toy implementation of socket programming for Lean 4.

## Installation

### Lake

```lean
import Lake
open System Lake DSL

package foo where
  dependencies := #[{
    name := `socket
    src := Source.git "https://github.com/xubaiw/lean4-socket.git" "main"
  }]
```

## Usage

This prints out yout local address.

```lean 
import Socket
open Socket

def main : IO Unit := do
  let addr ‚Üê SockAddr.mk "localhost" "8080"
  IO.println addr
```

# Documentation

The documentation generated by `doc-gen4` can be found [here](https://xubaiw.github.io/Socket.lean/).

There are also basic usage in the [`examples`](./examples) directory.

## Limitations

- Many low level flags are unavailable now.
- Only blocking sockets are supported. 
- No dependent type and linear constraints.
