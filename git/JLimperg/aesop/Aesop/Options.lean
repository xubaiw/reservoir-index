Options that modify Aesop's behaviour. Available options are:

- `maxRuleApplicationDepth`: maximum number of rule applications in any branch
  of the search tree, aka maximum search depth. When a branch exceeds this
  limit, it is considered unprovable; other branches may still be explored. 0
  means no limit.
- `maxRuleApplications`: maximum number of rule applications in the search tree.
  When this limit is exceeded, the search ends. 0 means no limit.
- `maxGoals`: maximum number of goals in the search tree. When this limit is
  exceeded, the search ends. 0 means no limit.
- `maxNormIterations`: maximum number of norm rules applied to a *single* goal.
  When this limit is exceeded, normalisation is likely stuck in an infinite loop
  so Aesop fails. 0 means no limit.
