# Multiplicative action on the completion of a uniform space

In this file we define typeclasses `has_uniform_continuous_const_vadd` and
`has_uniform_continuous_const_smul` and prove that a multiplicative action on `X` with uniformly
continuous `(•) c` can be extended to a multiplicative action on `uniform_space.completion X`.

In later files once the additive group structure is set up, we provide
* `uniform_space.completion.distrib_mul_action`
* `uniform_space.completion.mul_action_with_zero`
* `uniform_space.completion.module`
