# Finite dimensional topological vector spaces over complete fields

Let `𝕜` be a complete nontrivially normed field, and `E` a topological vector space (TVS) over
`𝕜` (i.e we have `[add_comm_group E] [module 𝕜 E] [topological_space E] [topological_add_group E]`
and `[has_continuous_smul 𝕜 E]`).

If `E` is finite dimensional and Hausdorff, then all linear maps from `E` to any other TVS are
continuous.

When `E` is a normed space, this gets us the equivalence of norms in finite dimension.

## Main results :

* `linear_map.continuous_iff_is_closed_ker` : a linear form is continuous if and only if its kernel
  is closed.
* `linear_map.continuous_of_finite_dimensional` : a linear map on a finite-dimensional Hausdorff
  space over a complete field is continuous.

## TODO

Generalize more of `analysis/normed_space/finite_dimension` to general TVSs.

## Implementation detail

The main result from which everything follows is the fact that, if `ξ : ι → E` is a finite basis,
then `ξ.equiv_fun : E →ₗ (ι → 𝕜)` is continuous. However, for technical reasons, it is easier to
prove this when `ι` and `E` live ine the same universe. So we start by doing that as a private
lemma, then we deduce `linear_map.continuous_of_finite_dimensional` from it, and then the general
result follows as `continuous_equiv_fun_basis`.
