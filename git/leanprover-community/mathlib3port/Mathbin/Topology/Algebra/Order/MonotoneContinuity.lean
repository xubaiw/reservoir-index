# Continuity of monotone functions

In this file we prove the following fact: if `f` is a monotone function on a neighborhood of `a`
and the image of this neighborhood is a neighborhood of `f a`, then `f` is continuous at `a`, see
`continuous_at_of_monotone_on_of_image_mem_nhds`, as well as several similar facts.

We also prove that an `order_iso` is continuous.

### Continuity of order isomorphisms

In this section we prove that an `order_iso` is continuous, hence it is a `homeomorph`. We prove
this for an `order_iso` between to partial orders with order topology.
