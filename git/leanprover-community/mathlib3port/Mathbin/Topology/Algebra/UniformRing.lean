# Completion of topological rings:

This files endows the completion of a topological ring with a ring structure.
More precisely the instance `uniform_space.completion.ring` builds a ring structure
on the completion of a ring endowed with a compatible uniform structure in the sense of
`uniform_add_group`. There is also a commutative version when the original ring is commutative.
Moreover, if a topological ring is an algebra over a commutative semiring, then so is its
`uniform_space.completion`.

The last part of the file builds a ring structure on the biggest separated quotient of a ring.

## Main declarations:

Beyond the instances explained above (that don't have to be explicitly invoked),
the main constructions deal with continuous ring morphisms.

* `uniform_space.completion.extension_hom`: extends a continuous ring morphism from `R`
  to a complete separated group `S` to `completion R`.
* `uniform_space.completion.map_ring_hom` : promotes a continuous ring morphism
  from `R` to `S` into a continuous ring morphism from `completion R` to `completion S`.

TODO: Generalise the results here from the concrete `completion` to any `abstract_completion`.
