# The topological support of a function

In this file we define the topological support of a function `f`, `tsupport f`,
as the closure of the support of `f`.

Furthermore, we say that `f` has compact support if the topological support of `f` is compact.

## Main definitions

* `function.mul_tsupport` & `function.tsupport`
* `function.has_compact_mul_support` & `function.has_compact_support`

## Implementation Notes

* We write all lemmas for multiplicative functions, and use `@[to_additive]` to get the more common
  additive versions.
* We do not put the definitions in the `function` namespace, following many other topological
  definitions that are in the root namespace (compare `embedding` vs `function.embedding`).
