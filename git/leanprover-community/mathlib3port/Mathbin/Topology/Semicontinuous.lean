# Semicontinuous maps

A function `f` from a topological space `α` to an ordered space `β` is lower semicontinuous at a
point `x` if, for any `y < f x`, for any `x'` close enough to `x`, one has `f x' > y`. In other
words, `f` can jump up, but it can not jump down.

Upper semicontinuous functions are defined similarly.

This file introduces these notions, and a basic API around them mimicking the API for continuous
functions.

## Main definitions and results

We introduce 4 definitions related to lower semicontinuity:
* `lower_semicontinuous_within_at f s x`
* `lower_semicontinuous_at f x`
* `lower_semicontinuous_on f s`
* `lower_semicontinuous f`

We build a basic API using dot notation around these notions, and we prove that
* constant functions are lower semicontinuous;
* `indicator s (λ _, y)` is lower semicontinuous when `s` is open and `0 ≤ y`, or when `s` is closed
  and `y ≤ 0`;
* continuous functions are lower semicontinuous;
* composition with a continuous monotone functions maps lower semicontinuous functions to lower
  semicontinuous functions. If the function is anti-monotone, it instead maps lower semicontinuous
  functions to upper semicontinuous functions;
* a sum of two (or finitely many) lower semicontinuous functions is lower semicontinuous;
* a supremum of a family of lower semicontinuous functions is lower semicontinuous;
* An infinite sum of `ℝ≥0∞`-valued lower semicontinuous functions is lower semicontinuous.

Similar results are stated and proved for upper semicontinuity.

We also prove that a function is continuous if and only if it is both lower and upper
semicontinuous.

## Implementation details

All the nontrivial results for upper semicontinuous functions are deduced from the corresponding
ones for lower semicontinuous functions using `order_dual`.
