# Continuous open maps

This file defines bundled continuous open maps.

We use the `fun_like` design, so each type of morphisms has a companion typeclass which is meant to
be satisfied by itself and all stricter types.

## Types of morphisms

* `continuous_open_map`: Continuous open maps.

## Typeclasses

* `continuous_open_map_class`
