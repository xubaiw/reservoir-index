# Continuous bundled maps

In this file we define the type `continuous_map` of continuous bundled maps.

We use the `fun_like` design, so each type of morphisms has a companion typeclass which is meant to
be satisfied by itself and all stricter types.

open Function

/-- The type of continuous maps from `α` to `β`.

When possible, instead of parametrizing results over `(f : C(α, β))`,
you should parametrize over `{F : Type*} [continuous_map_class F α β] (f : F)`.

When you extend this structure, make sure to extend `continuous_map_class`. -/
