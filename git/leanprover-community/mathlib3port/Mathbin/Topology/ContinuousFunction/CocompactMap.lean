# Cocompact continuous maps

The type of *cocompact continuous maps* are those which tend to the cocompact filter on the
codomain along the cocompact filter on the domain. When the domain and codomain are Hausdorff, this
is equivalent to many other conditions, including that preimages of compact sets are compact. -/

/-! ### Cocompact continuous maps -/


/-- A *cocompact continuous map* is a continuous function between topological spaces which
tends to the cocompact filter along the cocompact filter. Functions for which preimages of compact
sets are compact always satisfy this property, and the converse holds for cocompact continuous maps
when the codomain is Hausdorff (see `cocompact_map.tendsto_of_forall_preimage` and
`cocompact_map.compact_preimage`) -/
