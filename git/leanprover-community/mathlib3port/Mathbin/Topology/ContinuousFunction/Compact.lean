# Continuous functions on a compact space

Continuous functions `C(α, β)` from a compact space `α` to a metric space `β`
are automatically bounded, and so acquire various structures inherited from `α →ᵇ β`.

This file transfers these structures, and restates some lemmas
characterising these structures.

If you need a lemma which is proved about `α →ᵇ β` but not for `C(α, β)` when `α` is compact,
you should restate it here. You can also use
`bounded_continuous_function.equiv_continuous_map_of_compact` to move functions back and forth.

In particular:
