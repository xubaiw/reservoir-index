# Any T0 space embeds in a product of copies of the Sierpinski space.

We consider `Prop` with the Sierpinski topology. If `X` is a topological space, there is a
continuous map `product_of_mem_opens` from `X` to `opens X → Prop` which is the product of the maps
`X → Prop` given by `x ↦ x ∈ u`.

The map `product_of_mem_opens` is always inducing. Whenever `X` is T0, `product_of_mem_opens` is
also injective and therefore an embedding.
