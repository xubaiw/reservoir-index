# Local homeomorphisms

This file defines local homeomorphisms.

## Main definitions

* `is_locally_homeomorph`: A function `f : X ‚Üí Y` satisfies `is_locally_homeomorph` if for each
  point `x : X`, the restriction of `f` to some open neighborhood `U` of `x` gives a homeomorphism
  between `U` and an open subset of `Y`.

  Note that `is_locally_homeomorph` is a global condition. This is in contrast to
  `local_homeomorph`, which is a homeomorphism between specific open subsets.

/-- Proves that `f` satisfies `is_locally_homeomorph`. The condition `h` is weaker than definition
of `is_locally_homeomorph`, since it only requires `e : local_homeomorph X Y` to agree with `f` on
its source `e.source`, as opposed to on the whole space `X`. -/
