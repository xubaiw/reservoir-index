# Extending a function from a subset

The main definition of this file is `extend_from A f` where `f : X → Y`
and `A : set X`. This defines a new function `g : X → Y` which maps any
`x₀ : X` to the limit of `f` as `x` tends to `x₀`, if such a limit exists.

This is analoguous to the way `dense_inducing.extend` "extends" a function
`f : X → Z` to a function `g : Y → Z` along a dense inducing `i : X → Y`.

The main theorem we prove about this definition is `continuous_on_extend_from`
which states that, for `extend_from A f` to be continuous on a set `B ⊆ closure A`,
it suffices that `f` converges within `A` at any point of `B`, provided that
`f` is a function to a regular space.

at any `x₀`, if `f` converges to some `y` as `x` tends to `x₀` within `A`,
then `g x₀` is defined to be one of these `y`. Else, `g x₀` could be anything. -/
