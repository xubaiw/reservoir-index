# Uniform convergence

A sequence of functions `Fₙ` (with values in a metric space) converges uniformly on a set `s` to a
function `f` if, for all `ε > 0`, for all large enough `n`, one has for all `y ∈ s` the inequality
`dist (f y, Fₙ y) < ε`. Under uniform convergence, many properties of the `Fₙ` pass to the limit,
most notably continuity. We prove this in the file, defining the notion of uniform convergence
in the more general setting of uniform spaces, and with respect to an arbitrary indexing set
endowed with a filter (instead of just `ℕ` with `at_top`).

## Main results

Let `α` be a topological space, `β` a uniform space, `Fₙ` and `f` be functions from `α`to `β`
(where the index `n` belongs to an indexing type `ι` endowed with a filter `p`).

* `tendsto_uniformly_on F f p s`: the fact that `Fₙ` converges uniformly to `f` on `s`. This means
  that, for any entourage `u` of the diagonal, for large enough `n` (with respect to `p`), one has
  `(f y, Fₙ y) ∈ u` for all `y ∈ s`.
* `tendsto_uniformly F f p`: same notion with `s = univ`.
* `tendsto_uniformly_on.continuous_on`: a uniform limit on a set of functions which are continuous
  on this set is itself continuous on this set.
* `tendsto_uniformly.continuous`: a uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous.
* `tendsto_uniformly_on.tendsto_comp`: If `Fₙ` tends uniformly to `f` on a set `s`, and `gₙ` tends
  to `x` within `s`, then `Fₙ gₙ` tends to `f x` if `f` is continuous at `x` within `s`.
* `tendsto_uniformly.tendsto_comp`: If `Fₙ` tends uniformly to `f`, and `gₙ` tends to `x`, then
  `Fₙ gₙ` tends to `f x`.

We also define notions where the convergence is locally uniform, called
`tendsto_locally_uniformly_on F f p s` and `tendsto_locally_uniformly F f p`. The previous theorems
all have corresponding versions under locally uniform convergence.

## Implementation notes

Most results hold under weaker assumptions of locally uniform approximation. In a first section,
we prove the results under these weaker assumptions. Then, we derive the results on uniform
convergence from them.

### Different notions of uniform convergence

We define uniform convergence and locally uniform convergence, on a set or in the whole space.

### Uniform approximation

uniformly by continuous functions. We give various versions, within a set or the whole space, at
a single point or at all points, with locally uniform approximation or uniform approximation. All
the statements are derived from a statement about locally uniform approximation within a set at
a point, called `continuous_within_at_of_locally_uniform_approx_of_continuous_within_at`. -/

### Composing limits under uniform convergence

In general, if `Fₙ` converges pointwise to a function `f`, and `gₙ` tends to `x`, it is not true
that `Fₙ gₙ` tends to `f x`. It is true however if the convergence of `Fₙ` to `f` is uniform. In
this paragraph, we prove variations around this statement.

/-- If `Fₙ` converges locally uniformly on a neighborhood of `x` within a set `s` to a function `f`
which is continuous at `x` within `s `, and `gₙ` tends to `x` within `s`, then `Fₙ (gₙ)` tends
to `f x`. -/
