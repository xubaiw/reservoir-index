# Compact separated uniform spaces

## Main statements

* `compact_space_uniformity`: On a separated compact uniform space, the topology determines the
  uniform structure, entourages are exactly the neighborhoods of the diagonal.
* `uniform_space_of_compact_t2`: every compact T2 topological structure is induced by a uniform
  structure. This uniform structure is described in the previous item.
* Heine-Cantor theorem: continuous functions on compact separated uniform spaces with values in
  uniform spaces are automatically uniformly continuous. There are several variations, the main one
  is `compact_space.uniform_continuous_of_continuous`.

## Implementation notes

The construction `uniform_space_of_compact_t2` is not declared as an instance, as it would badly
loop.
