# Sheaves

We define sheaves on a topological space, with values in an arbitrary category with products.

The sheaf condition for a `F : presheaf C X` requires that the morphism
`F.obj U ⟶ ∏ F.obj (U i)` (where `U` is some open set which is the union of the `U i`)
is the equalizer of the two morphisms
`∏ F.obj (U i) ⟶ ∏ F.obj (U i ⊓ U j)`.

We provide the instance `category (sheaf C X)` as the full subcategory of presheaves,
and the fully faithful functor `sheaf.forget : sheaf C X ⥤ presheaf C X`.

## Equivalent conditions

While the "official" definition is in terms of an equalizer diagram,
in `src/topology/sheaves/sheaf_condition/pairwise_intersections.lean`
and in `src/topology/sheaves/sheaf_condition/open_le_cover.lean`
we provide two equivalent conditions (and prove they are equivalent).

The first is that `F.obj U` is the limit point of the diagram consisting of all the `F.obj (U i)`
and `F.obj (U i ⊓ U j)`.
(That is, we explode the equalizer of two products out into its component pieces.)

The second is that `F.obj U` is the limit point of the diagram constisting of all the `F.obj V`,
for those `V : opens X` such that `V ≤ U i` for some `i`.
(This condition is particularly easy to state, and perhaps should become the "official" definition.)
