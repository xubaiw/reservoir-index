# Identically distributed random variables

Two random variables defined on two (possibly different) probability spaces but taking value in
the same space are *identically distributed* if their distributions (i.e., the image probability
measures on the target space) coincide. We define this concept and establish its basic properties
in this file.

## Main definitions and results

* `ident_distrib f g μ ν` registers that the image of `μ` under `f` coincides with the image of `ν`
  under `g` (and that `f` and `g` are almost everywhere measurable, as otherwise the image measures
  don't make sense). The measures can be kept implicit as in `ident_distrib f g` if the spaces
  are registered as measure spaces.
* `ident_distrib.comp`: being identically distributed is stable under composition with measurable
  maps.

There are two main kind of lemmas, under the assumption that `f` and `g` are identically
distributed: lemmas saying that two quantities computed for `f` and `g` are the same, and lemmas
saying that if `f` has some property then `g` also has it. The first kind is registered as
`ident_distrib.foo_eq`, the second one as `ident_distrib.foo_snd` (in the latter case, to deduce
a property of `f` from one of `g`, use `h.symm.foo_snd` where `h : ident_distrib f g μ ν`). For
instance:

* `ident_distrib.measure_mem_eq`: if `f` and `g` are identically distributed, then the probabilities
  that they belong to a given measurable set are the same.
* `ident_distrib.integral_eq`: if `f` and `g` are identically distributed, then their integrals
  are the same.
* `ident_distrib.variance_eq`: if `f` and `g` are identically distributed, then their variances
  are the same.

* `ident_distrib.ae_strongly_measurable_snd`: if `f` and `g` are identically distributed and `f`
  is almost everywhere strongly measurable, then so is `g`.
* `ident_distrib.mem_ℒp_snd`: if `f` and `g` are identically distributed and `f`
  belongs to `ℒp`, then so does `g`.

We also register several dot notation shortcuts for convenience.
For instance, if `h : ident_distrib f g μ ν`, then `h.sq` states that `f^2` and `g^2` are
identically distributed, and `h.norm` states that `∥f∥` and `∥g∥` are identically distributed, and
so on.
