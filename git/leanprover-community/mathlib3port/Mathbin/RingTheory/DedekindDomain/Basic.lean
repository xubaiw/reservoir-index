# Dedekind domains

This file defines the notion of a Dedekind domain (or Dedekind ring),
as a Noetherian integrally closed commutative ring of Krull dimension at most one.

## Main definitions

 - `is_dedekind_domain` defines a Dedekind domain as a commutative ring that is
   Noetherian, integrally closed in its field of fractions and has Krull dimension at most one.
   `is_dedekind_domain_iff` shows that this does not depend on the choice of field of fractions.

## Implementation notes

The definitions that involve a field of fractions choose a canonical field of fractions,
but are independent of that choice. The `..._iff` lemmas express this independence.

Often, definitions assume that Dedekind domains are not fields. We found it more practical
to add a `(h : ¬ is_field A)` assumption whenever this is explicitly needed.

/-- A Dedekind domain is an integral domain that is Noetherian, integrally closed, and
has Krull dimension at most one.

This is definition 3.2 of [Neukirch1992].

The integral closure condition is independent of the choice of field of fractions:
use `is_dedekind_domain_iff` to prove `is_dedekind_domain` for a given `fraction_map`.

This is the default implementation, but there are equivalent definitions,
`is_dedekind_domain_dvr` and `is_dedekind_domain_inv`.
TODO: Prove that these are actually equivalent definitions.
