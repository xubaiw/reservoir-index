# Dedekind domains

This file defines an equivalent notion of a Dedekind domain (or Dedekind ring),
namely a Noetherian integral domain where the localization at all nonzero prime ideals is a DVR
(TODO: and shows that it is equivalent to the main definition).

## Main definitions

 - `is_dedekind_domain_dvr` alternatively defines a Dedekind domain as an integral domain that
   is Noetherian, and the localization at every nonzero prime ideal is a DVR.

## Implementation notes

The definitions that involve a field of fractions choose a canonical field of fractions,
but are independent of that choice. The `..._iff` lemmas express this independence.

Often, definitions assume that Dedekind domains are not fields. We found it more practical
to add a `(h : ¬ is_field A)` assumption whenever this is explicitly needed.

/-- A Dedekind domain is an integral domain that is Noetherian, and the
localization at every nonzero prime is a discrete valuation ring.

This is equivalent to `is_dedekind_domain`.
