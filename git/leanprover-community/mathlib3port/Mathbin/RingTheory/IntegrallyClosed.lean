# Integrally closed rings

An integrally closed domain `R` contains all the elements of `Frac(R)` that are
integral over `R`. A special case of integrally closed domains are the Dedekind domains.

## Main definitions

* `is_integrally_closed R` states `R` contains all integral elements of `Frac(R)`

## Main results

* `is_integrally_closed_iff K`, where `K` is a fraction field of `R`, states `R`
  is integrally closed iff it is the integral closure of `R` in `K`

/-- `R` is integrally closed if all integral elements of `Frac(R)` are also elements of `R`.

This definition uses `fraction_ring R` to denote `Frac(R)`. See `is_integrally_closed_iff`
if you want to choose another field of fractions for `R`.
