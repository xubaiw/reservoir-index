# Categories

Defines a category, as a type class parametrised by the type of objects.

## Notations

Introduces notations
* `X ⟶ Y` for the morphism spaces,
* `f ≫ g` for composition in the 'arrows' convention.

Users may like to add `f ⊚ g` for composition in the standard convention, using
```lean
local notation f ` ⊚ `:80 g:80 := category.comp g f    -- type as \oo
```

library_note "category_theory universes"/--
The typeclass `category C` describes morphisms associated to objects of type `C : Type u`.

The universe levels of the objects and morphisms are independent, and will often need to be
specified explicitly, as `category.{v} C`.

Typically any concrete example will either be a `small_category`, where `v = u`,
which can be introduced as
```
universes u
variables {C : Type u} [small_category C]
```
or a `large_category`, where `u = v+1`, which can be introduced as
```
universes u
variables {C : Type (u+1)} [large_category C]
```

In order for the library to handle these cases uniformly,
we generally work with the unconstrained `category.{v u}`,
for which objects live in `Type u` and morphisms live in `Type v`.

Because the universe parameter `u` for the objects can be inferred from `C`
when we write `category C`, while the universe parameter `v` for the morphisms
can not be automatically inferred, through the category theory library
we introduce universe parameters with morphism levels listed first,
as in
```
universes v u
```
or
```
universes v₁ v₂ u₁ u₂
```
when multiple independent universes are needed.

This has the effect that we can simply write `category.{v} C`
(that is, only specifying a single parameter) while `u` will be inferred.

Often, however, it's not even necessary to include the `.{v}`.
(Although it was in earlier versions of Lean.)
If it is omitted a "free" universe will be used.

library_note "dsimp, simp"/-- Many proofs in the category theory library use the `dsimp, simp` pattern,
which typically isn't necessary elsewhere.

One would usually hope that the same effect could be achieved simply with `simp`.

The essential issue is that composition of morphisms involves dependent types.
When you have a chain of morphisms being composed, say `f : X ⟶ Y` and `g : Y ⟶ Z`,
then `simp` can operate succesfully on the morphisms
(e.g. if `f` is the identity it can strip that off).

However if we have an equality of objects, say `Y = Y'`,
then `simp` can't operate because it would break the typing of the composition operations.
We rarely have interesting equalities of objects
(because that would be "evil" --- anything interesting should be expressed as an isomorphism
and tracked explicitly),
except of course that we have plenty of definitional equalities of objects.

`dsimp` can apply these safely, even inside a composition.

After `dsimp` has cleared up the object level, `simp` can resume work on the morphism level ---
but without the `dsimp` step, because `simp` looks at expressions syntactically,
the relevant lemmas might not fire.

There's no bound on how many times you potentially could have to switch back and forth,
if the `simp` introduced new objects we again need to `dsimp`.
In practice this does occur, but only rarely, because `simp` tends to shorten chains of compositions
(i.e. not introduce new objects at all).
