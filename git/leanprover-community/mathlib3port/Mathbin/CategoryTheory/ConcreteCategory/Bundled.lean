# Bundled types

`bundled c` provides a uniform structure for bundling a type equipped with a type class.

We provide `category` instances for these in `category_theory/unbundled_hom.lean`
(for categories with unbundled homs, e.g. topological spaces)
and in `category_theory/bundled_hom.lean` (for categories with bundled homs, e.g. monoids).

/-- Map over the bundled structure -/

`bundled.map` is reducible so that, if we define a category

  def Ring : Type (u+1) := induced_category SemiRing (bundled.map @ring.to_semiring)

instance search is able to "see" that a morphism R ⟶ S in Ring is really
a (semi)ring homomorphism from R.α to S.α, and not merely from
`(bundled.map @ring.to_semiring R).α` to `(bundled.map @ring.to_semiring S).α`.
