# Essential image of a functor

The essential image `ess_image` of a functor consists of the objects in the target category which
are isomorphic to an object in the image of the object function.
This, for instance, allows us to talk about objects belonging to a subcategory expressed as a
functor rather than a subtype, preserving the principle of equivalence. For example this lets us
define exponential ideals.

The essential image can also be seen as a subcategory of the target category, and witnesses that
a functor decomposes into a essentially surjective functor and a fully faithful functor.
(TODO: show that this decomposition forms an orthogonal factorisation system).

/-- The essential image of a functor `F` consists of those objects in the target category which are
isomorphic to an object in the image of the function `F.obj`. In other words, this is the closure
under isomorphism of the function `F.obj`.
This is the "non-evil" way of describing the image of a functor.
