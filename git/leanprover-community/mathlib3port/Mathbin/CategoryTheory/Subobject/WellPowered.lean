# Well-powered categories

A category `(C : Type u) [category.{v} C]` is `[well_powered C]` if
for every `X : C`, we have `small.{v} (subobject X)`.

(Note that in this situtation `subobject X : Type (max u v)`,
so this is a nontrivial condition for large categories,
but automatic for small categories.)

This is equivalent to the category `mono_over X` being `essentially_small.{v}` for all `X : C`.

When a category is well-powered, you can obtain nonconstructive witnesses as
`shrink (subobject X) : Type v`
and
`equiv_shrink (subobject X) : subobject X ≃ shrink (subobject X)`.

/-- A category (with morphisms in `Type v`) is well-powered if `subobject X` is `v`-small for every `X`.

We show in `well_powered_of_mono_over_essentially_small` and `mono_over_essentially_small`
that this is the case if and only if `mono_over X` is `v`-essentially small for every `X`.
