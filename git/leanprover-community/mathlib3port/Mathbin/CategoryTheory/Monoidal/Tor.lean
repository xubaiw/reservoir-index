# Tor, the left-derived functor of tensor product

We define `Tor C n : C ⥤ C ⥤ C`, by left-deriving in the second factor of `(X, Y) ↦ X ⊗ Y`.

For now we have almost nothing to say about it!

It would be good to show that this is naturally isomorphic to the functor obtained
by left-deriving in the first factor, instead.
For now we define `Tor'` by left-deriving in the first factor,
but showing `Tor C n ≅ Tor' C n` will require a bit more theory!
Possibly it's best to axiomatize delta functors, and obtain a unique characterisation?
