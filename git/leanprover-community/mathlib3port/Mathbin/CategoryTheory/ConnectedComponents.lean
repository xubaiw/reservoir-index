# Connected components of a category

Defines a type `connected_components J` indexing the connected components of a category, and the
full subcategories giving each connected component: `component j : Type u₁`.
We show that each `component j` is in fact connected.

We show every category can be expressed as a disjoint union of its connected components, in
particular `decomposed J` is the category (definitionally) given by the sigma-type of the connected
components of `J`, and it is shown that this is equivalent to `J`.
