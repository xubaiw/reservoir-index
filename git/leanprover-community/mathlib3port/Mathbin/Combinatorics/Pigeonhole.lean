# Pigeonhole principles

Given pigeons (possibly infinitely many) in pigeonholes, the
pigeonhole principle states that, if there are more pigeons than
pigeonholes, then there is a pigeonhole with two or more pigeons.

There are a few variations on this statement, and the conclusion can
be made stronger depending on how many pigeons you know you might
have.

The basic statements of the pigeonhole principle appear in the
following locations:

* `data.finset.basic` has `finset.exists_ne_map_eq_of_card_lt_of_maps_to`
* `data.fintype.basic` has `fintype.exists_ne_map_eq_of_card_lt`
* `data.fintype.basic` has `fintype.exists_ne_map_eq_of_infinite`
* `data.fintype.basic` has `fintype.exists_infinite_fiber`
* `data.set.finite` has `set.infinite.exists_ne_map_eq_of_maps_to`

This module gives access to these pigeonhole principles along with 20 more.
The versions vary by:

* using a function between `fintype`s or a function between possibly infinite types restricted to
  `finset`s;
* counting pigeons by a general weight function (`∑ x in s, w x`) or by heads (`finset.card s`);
* using strict or non-strict inequalities;
* establishing upper or lower estimate on the number (or the total weight) of the pigeons in one
  pigeonhole;
* in case when we count pigeons by some weight function `w` and consider a function `f` between
  `finset`s `s` and `t`, we can either assume that each pigeon is in one of the pigeonholes
  (`∀ x ∈ s, f x ∈ t`), or assume that for `y ∉ t`, the total weight of the pigeons in this
  pigeonhole `∑ x in s.filter (λ x, f x = y), w x` is nonpositive or nonnegative depending on
  the inequality we are proving.

Lemma names follow `mathlib` convention (e.g.,
`finset.exists_lt_sum_fiber_of_maps_to_of_nsmul_lt_sum`); "pigeonhole principle" is mentioned in the
docstrings instead of the names.

## See also

* `ordinal.infinite_pigeonhole`: pigeonhole principle for cardinals, formulated using cofinality;

* `measure_theory.exists_nonempty_inter_of_measure_univ_lt_tsum_measure`,
  `measure_theory.exists_nonempty_inter_of_measure_univ_lt_sum_measure`: pigeonhole principle in a
  measure space.

## TODO

The `_nsmul` lemmas could be generalized from `linear_ordered_comm_ring` to
`linear_ordered_comm_semiring` if the latter existed (or some combination of
`covariant`/`contravariant` classes once the refactor has gone deep enough). This would allow
deriving the `_mul` lemmas from the `_nsmul` ones.

### The pigeonhole principles on `finset`s, pigeons counted by weight

In this section we prove the following version of the pigeonhole principle: if the total weight of a
finite set of pigeons is greater than `n • b`, and they are sorted into `n` pigeonholes, then for
some pigeonhole, the total weight of the pigeons in this pigeonhole is greater than `b`, and a few
variations of this theorem.

The principle is formalized in the following way, see
`finset.exists_lt_sum_fiber_of_maps_to_of_nsmul_lt_sum`: if `f : α → β` is a function which maps all
elements of `s : finset α` to `t : finset β` and `card t • b < ∑ x in s, w x`, where `w : α → M` is
a weight function taking values in a `linear_ordered_cancel_add_comm_monoid`, then for
some `y ∈ t`, the sum of the weights of all `x ∈ s` such that `f x = y` is greater than `b`.

There are a few bits we can change in this theorem:

* reverse all inequalities, with obvious adjustments to the name;
* replace the assumption `∀ a ∈ s, f a ∈ t` with
  `∀ y ∉ t, (∑ x in s.filter (λ x, f x = y), w x) ≤ 0`,
  and replace `of_maps_to` with `of_sum_fiber_nonpos` in the name;
* use non-strict inequalities assuming `t` is nonempty.

We can do all these variations independently, so we have eight versions of the theorem.

### The pigeonhole principles on `finset`s, pigeons counted by heads

In this section we formalize a few versions of the following pigeonhole principle: there is a
pigeonhole with at least as many pigeons as the ceiling of the average number of pigeons across all
pigeonholes.

First, we can use strict or non-strict inequalities. While the versions with non-strict inequalities
are weaker than those with strict inequalities, sometimes it might be more convenient to apply the
weaker version. Second, we can either state that there exists a pigeonhole with at least `n`
pigeons, or state that there exists a pigeonhole with at most `n` pigeons. In the latter case we do
not need the assumption `∀ a ∈ s, f a ∈ t`.

So, we prove four theorems: `finset.exists_lt_card_fiber_of_maps_to_of_mul_lt_card`,
`finset.exists_le_card_fiber_of_maps_to_of_mul_le_card`,
`finset.exists_card_fiber_lt_of_card_lt_mul`, and `finset.exists_card_fiber_le_of_card_le_mul`. -/

In this section we specialize theorems from the previous section to the special case of functions

holds, so we have four theorems instead of eight. -/

/-- The strong pigeonhole principle for finitely many pigeons and pigeonholes.  Given a function `f`
between finite types `α` and `β` and a number `n` such that `card α ≤ card β * n`, there exists an
element `y : β` such that its preimage has at most `n` elements. See also
`fintype.exists_card_fiber_lt_of_card_lt_mul` for a stronger statement. -/
