# Quivers

This module defines quivers. A quiver on a type `V` of vertices assigns to every
pair `a b : V` of vertices a type `a ⟶ b` of arrows from `a` to `b`. This
is a very permissive notion of directed graph.

## Implementation notes

Currently `quiver` is defined with `arrow : V → V → Sort v`.
This is different from the category theory setup,
where we insist that morphisms live in some `Type`.
There's some balance here: it's nice to allow `Prop` to ensure there are no multiple arrows,
but it is also results in error-prone universe signatures when constraints require a `Type`.

/-- A quiver `G` on a type `V` of vertices assigns to every pair `a b : V` of vertices
a type `a ⟶ b` of arrows from `a` to `b`.

For graphs with no repeated edges, one can use `quiver.{0} V`, which ensures
`a ⟶ b : Prop`. For multigraphs, one can use `quiver.{v+1} V`, which ensures
`a ⟶ b : Type v`.

Because `category` will later extend this class, we call the field `hom`.
Except when constructing instances, you should rarely see this, and use the `⟶` notation instead.
