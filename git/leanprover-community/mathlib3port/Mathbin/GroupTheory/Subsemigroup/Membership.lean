# Subsemigroups: membership criteria

In this file we prove various facts about membership in a subsemigroup.
The intent is to mimic `group_theory/submonoid/membership`, but currently this file is mostly a
stub and only provides rudimentary support.

* `mem_supr_of_directed`, `coe_supr_of_directed`, `mem_Sup_of_directed_on`,
  `coe_Sup_of_directed_on`: the supremum of a directed collection of subsemigroup is their union.

## TODO

* Define the `free_semigroup` generated by a set. This might require some rather substantial
  additions to low-level API. For example, developing the subtype of nonempty lists, then defining
  a product on nonempty lists, powers where the exponent is a positive natural, et cetera.
  Another option would be to define the `free_semigroup` as the subsemigroup (pushed to be a
  semigroup) of the `free_monoid` consisting of non-identity elements.
