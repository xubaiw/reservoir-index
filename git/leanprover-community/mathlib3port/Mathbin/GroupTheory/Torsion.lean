# Torsion groups

This file defines torsion groups, i.e. groups where all elements have finite order.

## Main definitions

* `monoid.is_torsion` a predicate asserting `G` is torsion, i.e. that all
  elements are of finite order.
* `comm_group.torsion G`, the torsion subgroup of an abelian group `G`
* `comm_monoid.torsion G`, the above stated for commutative monoids
* `monoid.is_torsion_free`, asserting no nontrivial elements have finite order in `G`
* `add_monoid.is_torsion` and `add_monoid.is_torsion_free` the additive versions of the above

## Implementation

All torsion monoids are really groups (which is proven here as `monoid.is_torsion.group`), but since
the definition can be stated on monoids it is implemented on `monoid` to match other declarations in
the group theory library.

## Tags

periodic group, aperiodic group, torsion subgroup, torsion abelian group

## Future work

* generalize to π-torsion(-free) groups for a set of primes π
* free, free solvable and free abelian groups are torsion free
* complete direct and free products of torsion free groups are torsion free
* groups which are residually finite p-groups with respect to 2 distinct primes are torsion free
