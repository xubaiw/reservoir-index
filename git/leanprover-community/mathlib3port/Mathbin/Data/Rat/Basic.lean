# Field Structure on the Rational Numbers

## Summary

We put the (discrete) field structure on the type `ℚ` of rational numbers that
was defined in `data.rat.defs`.

## Main Definitions

- `rat.field` is the field structure on `ℚ`.

## Implementation notes

We have to define the field structure in a separate file to avoid cyclic imports:
the `field` class contains a map from `ℚ` (see `field`'s docstring for the rationale),
so we have a dependency `rat.field → field → rat` that is reflected in the import
hierarchy `data.rat.basic → algebra.field.basic → data.rat.defs`.
