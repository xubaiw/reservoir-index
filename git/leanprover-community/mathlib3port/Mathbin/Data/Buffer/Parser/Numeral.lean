# Numeral parsers

This file expands on the existing `nat : parser ℕ` to provide parsers into any type `α` that
can be represented by a numeral, which relies on `α` having a 0, 1, and addition operation.
There are also convenience parsers that ensure that the numeral parsed in is not larger than
the cardinality of the type `α` , if it is known that `fintype α`. Additionally, there are
convenience parsers that parse in starting from "1", which can be useful for positive ordinals;
or parser from a given character or character range.

## Main definitions

* `parser.numeral` : The parser which uses `nat.cast`
  to map the result of `parser.nat` to the desired `α`
* `parser.numeral.of_fintype` :  The parser which `guard`s to make sure the parsed
  numeral is within the cardinality of the target `fintype` type `α`.

## Implementation details

When the `parser.numeral` or related parsers are invoked, the desired type is provided explicitly.
In many cases, it can be inferred, so one can write, for example
```lean
def get_fin : string → fin 5 :=
sum.elim (λ _, 0) id ∘ parser.run_string (parser.numeral.of_fintype _)
```

In the definitions of the parsers (except for `parser.numeral`), there is an
explicit `nat.bin_cast` instead an explicit or implicit `nat.cast`.
