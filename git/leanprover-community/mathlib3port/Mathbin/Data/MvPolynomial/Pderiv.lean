# Partial derivatives of polynomials

This file defines the notion of the formal *partial derivative* of a polynomial,
the derivative with respect to a single variable.
This derivative is not connected to the notion of derivative from analysis.
It is based purely on the polynomial exponents and coefficients.

## Main declarations

* `mv_polynomial.pderiv i p` : the partial derivative of `p` with respect to `i`, as a bundled
  derivation of `mv_polynomial σ R`.

## Notation

As in other polynomial files, we typically use the notation:

+ `σ : Type*` (indexing the variables)

+ `R : Type*` `[comm_ring R]` (the coefficients)

+ `s : σ →₀ ℕ`, a function from `σ` to `ℕ` which is zero away from a finite set.
This will give rise to a monomial in `mv_polynomial σ R` which mathematicians might call `X^s`

+ `a : R`

+ `i : σ`, with corresponding monomial `X i`, often denoted `X_i` by mathematicians

+ `p : mv_polynomial σ R`
