# Cast of factorials

This file allows calculating factorials (including ascending and descending ones) as elements of a
semiring.

This is particularly crucial for `nat.desc_factorial` as substraction on `ℕ` does **not** correspond
to substraction on a general semiring. For example, we can't rely on existing cast lemmas to prove
`↑(a.desc_factorial 2) = ↑a * (↑a - 1)`. We must use the fact that, whenever `↑(a - 1)` is not equal
to `↑a - 1`, the other factor is `0` anyway.
