# (Scalar) multiplication and (vector) addition as measurable equivalences

In this file we define the following measurable equivalences:

* `measurable_equiv.smul`: if a group `G` acts on `α` by measurable maps, then each element `c : G`
  defines a measurable automorphism of `α`;
* `measurable_equiv.vadd`: additive version of `measurable_equiv.smul`;
* `measurable_equiv.smul₀`: if a group with zero `G` acts on `α` by measurable maps, then each
  nonzero element `c : G` defines a measurable automorphism of `α`;
* `measurable_equiv.mul_left`: if `G` is a group with measurable multiplication, then left
  multiplication by `g : G` is a measurable automorphism of `G`;
* `measurable_equiv.add_left`: additive version of `measurable_equiv.mul_left`;
* `measurable_equiv.mul_right`: if `G` is a group with measurable multiplication, then right
  multiplication by `g : G` is a measurable automorphism of `G`;
* `measurable_equiv.add_right`: additive version of `measurable_equiv.mul_right`;
* `measurable_equiv.mul_left₀`, `measurable_equiv.mul_right₀`: versions of
  `measurable_equiv.mul_left` and `measurable_equiv.mul_right` for groups with zero;
* `measurable_equiv.inv`: `has_inv.inv` as a measurable automorphism
  of a group (or a group with zero);
* `measurable_equiv.neg`: negation as a measurable automorphism of an additive group.

We also deduce that the corresponding maps are measurable embeddings.
