# Tactics for measure theory

Currently we have one domain-specific tactic for measure theory: `measurability`.

This tactic is to a large extent a copy of the `continuity` tactic by Reid Barton.

### `measurability` tactic

Automatically solve goals of the form `measurable f`, `ae_measurable f μ` and `measurable_set s`.

Mark lemmas with `@[measurability]` to add them to the set of lemmas
used by `measurability`. Note: `to_additive` doesn't know yet how to
copy the attribute to the additive version.

/-- Tactic to apply `measurable.comp` when appropriate.

Applying `measurable.comp` is not always a good idea, so we have some
extra logic here to try to avoid bad cases.

* If the function we're trying to prove measurable is actually
  constant, and that constant is a function application `f z`, then
  measurable.comp would produce new goals `measurable f`, `measurable
  (λ _, z)`, which is silly. We avoid this by failing if we could
  apply `measurable_const`.

* measurable.comp will always succeed on `measurable (λ x, f x)` and
  produce new goals `measurable (λ x, x)`, `measurable f`. We detect
  this by failing if a new goal can be closed by applying
  measurable_id.

Applying `measurable.comp_ae_measurable` is not always a good idea, so we have some
extra logic here to try to avoid bad cases.

* If the function we're trying to prove measurable is actually
  constant, and that constant is a function application `f z`, then
  `measurable.comp_ae_measurable` would produce new goals `measurable f`, `ae_measurable
  (λ _, z) μ`, which is silly. We avoid this by failing if we could
  apply `ae_measurable_const`.

* `measurable.comp_ae_measurable` will always succeed on `ae_measurable (λ x, f x) μ` and
  can produce new goals (`measurable (λ x, x)`, `ae_measurable f μ`) or
  (`measurable f`, `ae_measurable (λ x, x) μ`). We detect those by failing if a new goal can be
  closed by applying `measurable_id` or `ae_measurable_id`.

/-- `measurability` solves goals of the form `measurable f`, `ae_measurable f μ`,
`ae_strongly_measurable f μ` or `measurable_set s` by applying lemmas tagged with the
`measurability` user attribute.

You can also use `measurability!`, which applies lemmas with `{ md := semireducible }`.
The default behaviour is more conservative, and only unfolds `reducible` definitions
when attempting to match lemmas with the goal.

`measurability?` reports back the proof term it found.
