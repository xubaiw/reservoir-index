# Typeclasses for measurability of lattice operations

In this file we define classes `has_measurable_sup` and `has_measurable_inf` and prove dot-style
lemmas (`measurable.sup`, `ae_measurable.sup` etc). For binary operations we define two typeclasses:

- `has_measurable_sup` says that both left and right sup are measurable;
- `has_measurable_sup₂` says that `λ p : α × α, p.1 ⊔ p.2` is measurable,

and similarly for other binary operations. The reason for introducing these classes is that in case
of topological space `α` equipped with the Borel `σ`-algebra, instances for `has_measurable_sup₂`
etc require `α` to have a second countable topology.

For instances relating, e.g., `has_continuous_sup` to `has_measurable_sup` see file
`measure_theory.borel_space`.
