# Vitali covering theorems

The topological Vitali covering theorem, in its most classical version, states the following.
Consider a family of balls `(B (x_i, r_i))_{i ∈ I}` in a metric space, with uniformly bounded
radii. Then one can extract a disjoint subfamily indexed by `J ⊆ I`, such that any `B (x_i, r_i)`
is included in a ball `B (x_j, 5 r_j)`.

We prove this theorem in `vitali.exists_disjoint_subfamily_covering_enlargment_closed_ball`.
It is deduced from a more general version, called
`vitali.exists_disjoint_subfamily_covering_enlargment`, which applies to any family of sets
together with a size function `δ` (think "radius" or "diameter").

We deduce the measurable Vitali covering theorem. Assume one is given a family `t` of closed sets
with nonempty interior, such that each `a ∈ t` is included in a ball `B (x, r)` and covers a
definite proportion of the ball `B (x, 6 r)` for a given measure `μ` (think of the situation
where `μ` is a doubling measure and `t` is a family of balls). Consider a set `s` at which the
family is fine, i.e., every point of `s` belongs to arbitrarily small elements of `t`. Then one
can extract from `t` a disjoint subfamily that covers almost all `s`. It is proved in
`vitali.exists_disjoint_covering_ae`.

A way to restate this theorem is to say that the set of closed sets `a` with nonempty interior
covering a fixed proportion `1/C` of the ball `closed_ball x (3 * diam a)` forms a Vitali family.
This version is given in `vitali.vitali_family`.

/-- Vitali covering theorem: given a set `t` of subsets of a type, one may extract a disjoint
subfamily `u` such that the `τ`-enlargment of this family covers all elements of `t`, where `τ > 1`
is any fixed number.

When `t` is a family of balls, the `τ`-enlargment of `ball x r` is `ball x ((1+2τ) r)`. In general,
it is expressed in terms of a function `δ` (think "radius" or "diameter"), positive and bounded on
all elements of `t`. The condition is that every element `a` of `t` should intersect an
element `b` of `u` of size larger than that of `a` up to `τ`, i.e., `δ b ≥ δ a / τ`.

  /- The proof could be formulated as a transfinite induction. First pick an element of `t` with `δ`
    as large as possible (up to a factor of `τ`). Then among the remaining elements not intersecting
    the already chosen one, pick another element with large `δ`. Go on forever (transfinitely) until
    there is nothing left.
  
    Instead, we give a direct Zorn-based argument. Consider a maximal family `u` of disjoint sets
    with the following property: if an element `a` of `t` intersects some element `b` of `u`, then it
    intersects some `b' ∈ u` with `δ b' ≥ δ a / τ`. Such a maximal family exists by Zorn. If this
    family did not intersect some element `a ∈ t`, then take an element `a' ∈ t` which does not
    intersect any element of `u`, with `δ a'` almost as large as possible. One checks easily
    that `u ∪ {a'}` still has this property, contradicting the maximality. Therefore, `u`
    intersects all elements of `t`, and by definition it satisfies all the desired properties.

nonempty interior, such that each `a ∈ t` is included in a ball `B (x, r)` and covers a definite
proportion of the ball `B (x, 6 r)` for a given measure `μ` (think of the situation where `μ` is
a doubling measure and `t` is a family of balls). Consider a (possible non-measurable) set `s`
at which the family is fine, i.e., every point of `s` belongs to arbitrarily small elements of `t`.
Then one can extract from `t` a disjoint subfamily that covers almost all `s`. -/

  /- The idea of the proof is the following. Assume for simplicity that `μ` is finite. Applying the
    abstract Vitali covering theorem with `δ = diam`, one obtains a disjoint subfamily `u`, such
    that any element of `t` intersects an element of `u` with comparable diameter. Fix `ε > 0`.
    Since the elements of `u` have summable measure, one can remove finitely elements `w_1, ..., w_n`.
    so that the measure of the remaining elements is `< ε`. Consider now a point `z` not
    in the `w_i`. There is a small ball around `z` not intersecting the `w_i` (as they are closed),
    an element `a ∈ t` contained in this small ball (as the family `t` is fine at `z`) and an element
    `b ∈ u` intersecting `a`, with comparable diameter (by definition of `u`). Then `z` belongs to the
    enlargement of `b`. This shows that `s \ (w_1 ∪ ... ∪ w_n)` is contained in
    `⋃ (b ∈ u \ {w_1, ... w_n}) (enlargement of b)`. The measure of the latter set is bounded by
    `∑ (b ∈ u \ {w_1, ... w_n}) C * μ b` (by the doubling property of the measure), which is at most
    `C ε`. Letting `ε` tend to `0` shows that `s` is almost everywhere covered by the family `u`.
  
    For the real argument, the measure is only locally finite. Therefore, we implement the same
    strategy, but locally restricted to balls on which the measure is finite. For this, we do not
    use the whole family `t`, but a subfamily `t'` supported on small balls (which is possible since
    the family is assumed to be fine at every point of `s`).
