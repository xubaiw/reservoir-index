## Moore complex

We construct the normalized Moore complex, as a functor
`simplicial_object C ⥤ chain_complex C ℕ`,
for any abelian category `C`.

The `n`-th object is intersection of
the kernels of `X.δ i : X.obj n ⟶ X.obj (n-1)`, for `i = 1, ..., n`.

The differentials are induced from `X.δ 0`,
which maps each of these intersections of kernels to the next.

This functor is one direction of the Dold-Kan equivalence, which we're still working towards.
