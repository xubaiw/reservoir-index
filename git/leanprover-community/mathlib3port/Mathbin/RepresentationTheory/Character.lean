# Characters of representations

This file introduces characters of representation and proves basic lemmas about how characters
behave under various operations on representations.

# TODO
* Once we have the monoidal closed structure on `fdRep k G` and a better API for the rigid
structure, `char_dual` and `char_lin_hom` should probably be stated in terms of `Vᘁ` and `ihom V W`.
