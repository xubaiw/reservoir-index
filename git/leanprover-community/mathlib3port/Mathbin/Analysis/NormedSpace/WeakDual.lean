# Weak dual of normed space

Let `E` be a normed space over a field `𝕜`. This file is concerned with properties of the weak-*
topology on the dual of `E`. By the dual, we mean either of the type synonyms
`normed_space.dual 𝕜 E` or `weak_dual 𝕜 E`, depending on whether it is viewed as equipped with its
usual operator norm topology or the weak-* topology.

It is shown that the canonical mapping `normed_space.dual 𝕜 E → weak_dual 𝕜 E` is continuous, and
as a consequence the weak-* topology is coarser than the topology obtained from the operator norm
(dual norm).

In this file, we also establish the Banach-Alaoglu theorem about the compactness of closed balls
in the dual of `E` (as well as sets of somewhat more general form) with respect to the weak-*
topology.

## Main definitions

The main definitions concern the canonical mapping `dual 𝕜 E → weak_dual 𝕜 E`.

* `normed_space.dual.to_weak_dual` and `weak_dual.to_normed_dual`: Linear equivalences from
  `dual 𝕜 E` to `weak_dual 𝕜 E` and in the converse direction.
* `normed_space.dual.continuous_linear_map_to_weak_dual`: A continuous linear mapping from
  `dual 𝕜 E` to `weak_dual 𝕜 E` (same as `normed_space.dual.to_weak_dual` but different bundled
  data).

## Main results

The first main result concerns the comparison of the operator norm topology on `dual 𝕜 E` and the
weak-* topology on (its type synonym) `weak_dual 𝕜 E`:
* `dual_norm_topology_le_weak_dual_topology`: The weak-* topology on the dual of a normed space is
  coarser (not necessarily strictly) than the operator norm topology.
* `weak_dual.is_compact_polar` (a version of the Banach-Alaoglu theorem): The polar set of a
  neighborhood of the origin in a normed space `E` over `𝕜` is compact in `weak_dual _ E`, if the
  nondiscrete normed field `𝕜` is proper as a topological space.
* `weak_dual.is_compact_closed_ball` (the most common special case of the Banach-Alaoglu theorem):
  Closed balls in the dual of a normed space `E` over `ℝ` or `ℂ` are compact in the weak-star
  topology.

TODOs:
* Add that in finite dimensions, the weak-* topology and the dual norm topology coincide.
* Add that in infinite dimensions, the weak-* topology is strictly coarser than the dual norm
  topology.
* Add metrizability of the dual unit ball (more generally weak-star compact subsets) of
  `weak_dual 𝕜 E` under the assumption of separability of `E`.
* Add the sequential Banach-Alaoglu theorem: the dual unit ball of a separable normed space `E`
  is sequentially compact in the weak-star topology. This would follow from the metrizability above.

## Notations

No new notation is introduced.

## Implementation notes

Weak-* topology is defined generally in the file `topology.algebra.module.weak_dual`.

When `E` is a normed space, the duals `dual 𝕜 E` and `weak_dual 𝕜 E` are type synonyms with
different topology instances.

For the proof of Banach-Alaoglu theorem, the weak dual of `E` is embedded in the space of
functions `E → 𝕜` with the topology of pointwise convergence.

The polar set `polar 𝕜 s` of a subset `s` of `E` is originally defined as a subset of the dual
`dual 𝕜 E`. We care about properties of these w.r.t. weak-* topology, and for this purpose give
the definition `weak_dual.polar 𝕜 s` for the "same" subset viewed as a subset of `weak_dual 𝕜 E`
(a type synonym of the dual but with a different topology instance).

### Weak star topology on duals of normed spaces

In this section, we prove properties about the weak-* topology on duals of normed spaces.
We prove in particular that the canonical mapping `dual 𝕜 E → weak_dual 𝕜 E` is continuous,
i.e., that the weak-* topology is coarser (not necessarily strictly) than the topology given
by the dual-norm (i.e. the operator-norm).
