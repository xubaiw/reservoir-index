# Normed space structure on the completion of a normed space

If `E` is a normed space over `𝕜`, then so is `uniform_space.completion E`. In this file we provide
necessary instances and define `uniform_space.completion.to_complₗᵢ` - coercion
`E → uniform_space.completion E` as a bundled linear isometry.
