# Removable singularity theorem

In this file we prove Riemann's removable singularity theorem: if `f : ℂ → E` is complex
differentiable in a punctured neighborhood of a point `c` and is bounded in a punctured neighborhood
of `c` (or, more generally, $f(z) - f(c)=o((z-c)^{-1})$), then it has a limit at `c` and the
function `function.update f c (lim (𝓝[≠] c) f)` is complex differentiable in a neighborhood of `c`.
