# The Unitary Group

This file defines elements of the unitary group `unitary_group n α`, where `α` is a `star_ring`.
This consists of all `n` by `n` matrices with entries in `α` such that the star-transpose is its
inverse. In addition, we define the group structure on `unitary_group n α`, and the embedding into
the general linear group `general_linear_group α (n → α)`.

We also define the orthogonal group `orthogonal_group n β`, where `β` is a `comm_ring`.

## Main Definitions

 * `matrix.unitary_group` is the type of matrices where the star-transpose is the inverse
 * `matrix.unitary_group.group` is the group structure (under multiplication)
 * `matrix.unitary_group.embedding_GL` is the embedding `unitary_group n α → GLₙ(α)`
 * `matrix.orthogonal_group` is the type of matrices where the transpose is the inverse
