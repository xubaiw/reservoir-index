# Orthogonal

This file contains definitions and properties concerning orthogonality of rows and columns.

## Main results

- `matrix.has_orthogonal_rows`:
  `A.has_orthogonal_rows` means `A` has orthogonal (with respect to `dot_product`) rows.
- `matrix.has_orthogonal_cols`:
  `A.has_orthogonal_cols` means `A` has orthogonal (with respect to `dot_product`) columns.
