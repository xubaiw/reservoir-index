# Characteristics of algebras

In this file we describe the characteristic of `R`-algebras.

In particular we are interested in the characteristic of free algebras over `R`
and the fraction field `fraction_ring R`.


## Main results

- `char_p_of_injective_algebra_map` If `R →+* A` is an injective algebra map
  then `A` has the same characteristic as `R`.

Instances constructed from this result:
- Any `free_algebra R X` has the same characteristic as `R`.
- The `fraction_ring R` of an integral domain `R` has the same characteristic as `R`.

/-- If the algebra map `R →+* A` is injective then `A` has the same characteristic as `R`. -/
theorem char_p_of_injective_algebra_map {R A : Type _} [CommSemiringₓ R] [Semiringₓ A] [Algebra R A]
    (h : Function.Injective (algebraMap R A)) (p : ℕ) [CharP R p] : CharP A p :=
  { cast_eq_zero_iff := fun x => by
      rw [← CharP.cast_eq_zero_iff R p x]
      change algebraMap ℕ A x = 0 ↔ algebraMap ℕ R x = 0
      rw [IsScalarTower.algebra_map_apply ℕ R A x]
      refine' Iff.trans _ h.eq_iff
      rw [RingHom.map_zero] }

theorem char_p_of_injective_algebra_map' (R A : Type _) [Field R] [Semiringₓ A] [Algebra R A] [Nontrivial A] (p : ℕ)
    [CharP R p] : CharP A p :=
  char_p_of_injective_algebra_map (algebraMap R A).Injective p

/-- If the algebra map `R →+* A` is injective and `R` has characteristic zero then so does `A`. -/
theorem char_zero_of_injective_algebra_map {R A : Type _} [CommSemiringₓ R] [Semiringₓ A] [Algebra R A]
    (h : Function.Injective (algebraMap R A)) [CharZero R] : CharZero A :=
  { cast_injective := fun x y hxy => by
      change algebraMap ℕ A x = algebraMap ℕ A y at hxy
      rw [IsScalarTower.algebra_map_apply ℕ R A x] at hxy
      rw [IsScalarTower.algebra_map_apply ℕ R A y] at hxy
      exact CharZero.cast_injective (h hxy) }

-- `char_p.char_p_to_char_zero A _ (char_p_of_injective_algebra_map h 0)` does not work
-- here as it would require `ring A`.
