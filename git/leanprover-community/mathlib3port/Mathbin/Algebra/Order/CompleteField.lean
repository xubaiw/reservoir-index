# Conditionally complete linear ordered fields

This file shows that the reals are unique, or, more formally, given a type satisfying the common
axioms of the reals (field, conditionally complete, linearly ordered) that there is an isomorphism
preserving these properties to the reals. This is `rat.induced_order_ring_iso`. Moreover this
isomorphism is unique.

We introduce definitions of conditionally complete linear ordered fields, and show all such are
archimedean. We also construct the natural map from a `linear_ordered_field` to such a field.

## Main definitions

* `conditionally_complete_linear_ordered_field`: A field satisfying the standard axiomatization of
  the real numbers, being a Dedekind complete and linear ordered field.
* `linear_ordered_field.induced_map`: A (unique) map from any archimedean linear ordered field to a
  conditionally complete linear ordered field. Various bundlings are available.

## Main results

* `unique.order_ring_hom` : Uniqueness of `order_ring_hom`s from an archimedean linear ordered field
  to a conditionally complete linear ordered field.
* `unique.order_ring_iso` : Uniqueness of `order_ring_iso`s between two
  conditionally complete linearly ordered fields.

### Rational cut map

The idea is that a conditionally complete linear ordered field is fully characterized by its copy of
the rationals. Hence we define `rat.cut_map β : α → set β` which sends `a : α` to the "rationals in
`β`" that are less than `a`.

### Induced map

`rat.cut_map` spits out a `set β`. To get something in `β`, we now take the supremum.
