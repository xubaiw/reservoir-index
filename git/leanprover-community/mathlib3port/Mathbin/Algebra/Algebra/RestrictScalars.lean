# The `restrict_scalars` type alias

See the documentation attached to the `restrict_scalars` definition for advice on how and when to
use this type alias. As described there, it is often a better choice to use the `is_scalar_tower`
typeclass instead.

## Main definitions

* `restrict_scalars R S M`: the `S`-module `M` viewed as an `R` module when `S` is an `R`-algebra.
  Note that by default we do *not* have a `module S (restrict_scalars R S M)` instance
  for the original action.
  This is available as a def `restrict_scalars.module_orig` if really needed.
* `restrict_scalars.add_equiv : restrict_scalars R S M ≃+ M`: the additive equivalence
  between the restricted and original space (in fact, they are definitionally equal,
  but sometimes it is helpful to avoid using this fact, to keep instances from leaking).
* `restrict_scalars.ring_equiv : restrict_scalars R S A ≃+* A`: the ring equivalence
   between the restricted and original space when the module is an algebra.

## See also

There are many similarly-named definitions elsewhere which do not refer to this type alias. These
refer to restricting the scalar type in a bundled type, such as from `A →ₗ[R] B` to `A →ₗ[S] B`:

* `linear_map.restrict_scalars`
* `linear_equiv.restrict_scalars`
* `alg_hom.restrict_scalars`
* `alg_equiv.restrict_scalars`
* `submodule.restrict_scalars`
* `subalgebra.restrict_scalars`

variable (R S M A : Type _)

/-- If we put an `R`-algebra structure on a semiring `S`, we get a natural equivalence from the
category of `S`-modules to the category of representations of the algebra `S` (over `R`). The type
synonym `restrict_scalars` is essentially this equivalence.

Warning: use this type synonym judiciously! Consider an example where we want to construct an
`R`-linear map from `M` to `S`, given:
```lean
variables (R S M : Type*)
variables [comm_semiring R] [semiring S] [algebra R S] [add_comm_monoid M] [module S M]
```
With the assumptions above we can't directly state our map as we have no `module R M` structure, but
`restrict_scalars` permits it to be written as:
```lean
-- an `R`-module structure on `M` is provided by `restrict_scalars` which is compatible
example : restrict_scalars R S M →ₗ[R] S := sorry
```
However, it is usually better just to add this extra structure as an argument:
```lean
-- an `R`-module structure on `M` and proof of its compatibility is provided by the user
example [module R M] [is_scalar_tower R S M] : M →ₗ[R] S := sorry
```
The advantage of the second approach is that it defers the duty of providing the missing typeclasses
`[module R M] [is_scalar_tower R S M]`. If some concrete `M` naturally carries these (as is often
the case) then we have avoided `restrict_scalars` entirely. If not, we can pass
`restrict_scalars R S M` later on instead of `M`.

Note that this means we almost always want to state definitions and lemmas in the language of
`is_scalar_tower` rather than `restrict_scalars`.

An example of when one might want to use `restrict_scalars` would be if one has a vector space
over a field of characteristic zero and wishes to make use of the `ℚ`-algebra structure. -/
