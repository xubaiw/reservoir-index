# Adjoining a zero/one to semigroups and related algebraic structures

This file contains different results about adjoining an element to an algebraic structure which then
behaves like a zero or a one. An example is adjoining a one to a semigroup to obtain a monoid. That
this provides an example of an adjunction is proved in `algebra.category.Mon.adjunctions`.

Another result says that adjoining to a group an element `zero` gives a `group_with_zero`. For more
information about these structures (which are not that standard in informal mathematics, see
`algebra.group_with_zero.basic`)
