# Invertible elements

This file defines a typeclass `invertible a` for elements `a` with a two-sided
multiplicative inverse.

The intent of the typeclass is to provide a way to write e.g. `⅟2` in a ring
like `ℤ[1/2]` where some inverses exist but there is no general `⁻¹` operator;
or to specify that a field has characteristic `≠ 2`.
It is the `Type`-valued analogue to the `Prop`-valued `is_unit`.

For constructions of the invertible element given a characteristic, see
`algebra/char_p/invertible` and other lemmas in that file.

## Notation

 * `⅟a` is `invertible.inv_of a`, the inverse of `a`

## Implementation notes

The `invertible` class lives in `Type`, not `Prop`, to make computation easier.
If multiplication is associative, `invertible` is a subsingleton anyway.

The `simp` normal form tries to normalize `⅟a` to `a ⁻¹`. Otherwise, it pushes
`⅟` inside the expression as much as possible.

Since `invertible a` is not a `Prop` (but it is a `subsingleton`), we have to be careful about
coherence issues: we should avoid having multiple non-defeq instances for `invertible a` in the
same context.  This file plays it safe and uses `def` rather than `instance` for most definitions,
users can choose which instances to use at the point of use.

For example, here's how you can use an `invertible 1` instance:
```lean
variables {α : Type*} [monoid α]

def something_that_needs_inverses (x : α) [invertible x] := sorry

section
local attribute [instance] invertible_one
def something_one := something_that_needs_inverses 1
end
```
