# Shapes of homological complexes

We define a structure `complex_shape ι` for describing the shapes of homological complexes
indexed by a type `ι`.
This is intended to capture chain complexes and cochain complexes, indexed by either `ℕ` or `ℤ`,
as well as more exotic examples.

Rather than insisting that the indexing type has a `succ` function
specifying where differentials should go,
inside `c : complex_shape` we have `c.rel : ι → ι → Prop`,
and when we define `homological_complex`
we only allow nonzero differentials `d i j` from `i` to `j` if `c.rel i j`.
Further, we require that `{ j // c.rel i j }` and `{ i // c.rel i j }` are subsingletons.
This means that the shape consists of some union of lines, rays, intervals, and circles.

Convenience functions `c.next` and `c.prev` provide, as an `option`, these related elements
when they exist.

This design aims to avoid certain problems arising from dependent type theory.
In particular we never have to ensure morphisms `d i : X i ⟶ X (succ i)` compose as
expected (which would often require rewriting by equations in the indexing type).
Instead such identities become separate proof obligations when verifying that a
complex we've constructed is of the desired shape.

If `α` is an `add_right_cancel_semigroup`, then we define `up α : complex_shape α`,
the shape appropriate for cohomology,so `d : X i ⟶ X j` is nonzero only when `j = i + 1`,
as well as `down α : complex_shape α`, appropriate for homology,
so `d : X i ⟶ X j` is nonzero only when `i = j + 1`.
(Later we'll introduce `cochain_complex` and `chain_complex` as abbreviations for
`homological_complex` with one of these shapes baked in.)

/-- A `c : complex_shape ι` describes the shape of a chain complex,
with chain groups indexed by `ι`.
Typically `ι` will be `ℕ`, `ℤ`, or `fin n`.

There is a relation `rel : ι → ι → Prop`,
and we will only allow a non-zero differential from `i` to `j` when `rel i j`.

There are axioms which imply `{ j // c.rel i j }` and `{ i // c.rel i j }` are subsingletons.
This means that the shape consists of some union of lines, rays, intervals, and circles.

Below we define `c.next` and `c.prev` which provide, as an `option`, these related elements.
