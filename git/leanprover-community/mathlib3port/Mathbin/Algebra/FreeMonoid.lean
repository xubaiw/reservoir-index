# Free monoid over a given alphabet

## Main definitions

* `free_monoid α`: free monoid over alphabet `α`; defined as a synonym for `list α`
  with multiplication given by `(++)`.
* `free_monoid.of`: embedding `α → free_monoid α` sending each element `x` to `[x]`;
* `free_monoid.lift`: natural equivalence between `α → M` and `free_monoid α →* M`
* `free_monoid.map`: embedding of `α → β` into `free_monoid α →* free_monoid β` given by `list.map`.
