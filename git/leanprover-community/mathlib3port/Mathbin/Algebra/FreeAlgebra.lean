# Free Algebras

Given a commutative semiring `R`, and a type `X`, we construct the free unital, associative
`R`-algebra on `X`.

## Notation

1. `free_algebra R X` is the free algebra itself. It is endowed with an `R`-algebra structure.
2. `free_algebra.ι R` is the function `X → free_algebra R X`.
3. Given a function `f : X → A` to an R-algebra `A`, `lift R f` is the lift of `f` to an
  `R`-algebra morphism `free_algebra R X → A`.

## Theorems

1. `ι_comp_lift` states that the composition `(lift R f) ∘ (ι R)` is identical to `f`.
2. `lift_unique` states that whenever an R-algebra morphism `g : free_algebra R X → A` is
  given whose composition with `ι R` is `f`, then one has `g = lift R f`.
3. `hom_ext` is a variant of `lift_unique` in the form of an extensionality theorem.
4. `lift_comp_ι` is a combination of `ι_comp_lift` and `lift_unique`. It states that the lift
  of the composition of an algebra morphism with `ι` is the algebra morphism itself.
5. `equiv_monoid_algebra_free_monoid : free_algebra R X ≃ₐ[R] monoid_algebra R (free_monoid X)`
6. An inductive principle `induction`.

## Implementation details

We construct the free algebra on `X` as a quotient of an inductive type `free_algebra.pre` by an
inductively defined relation `free_algebra.rel`. Explicitly, the construction involves three steps:
1. We construct an inductive type `free_algebra.pre R X`, the terms of which should be thought
  of as representatives for the elements of `free_algebra R X`.
  It is the free type with maps from `R` and `X`, and with two binary operations `add` and `mul`.
2. We construct an inductive relation `free_algebra.rel R X` on `free_algebra.pre R X`.
  This is the smallest relation for which the quotient is an `R`-algebra where addition resp.
  multiplication are induced by `add` resp. `mul` from 1., and for which the map from `R` is the
  structure map for the algebra.
3. The free algebra `free_algebra R X` is the quotient of `free_algebra.pre R X` by
  the relation `free_algebra.rel R X`.

At this stage we set the basic definitions as `@[irreducible]`, so from this point onwards one
should only use the universal properties of the free algebra, and consider the actual implementation
as a quotient of an inductive type as completely hidden.

Of course, one still has the option to locally make these definitions `semireducible` if so desired,
and Lean is still willing in some circumstances to do unification based on the underlying
definition.
