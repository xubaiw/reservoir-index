/-- The `ancestor` attributes is used to record the names of structures which appear in the
extends clause of a `structure` or `class` declared with `old_structure_cmd` set to true.

As an example:
```
set_option old_structure_cmd true

structure base_one := (one : ℕ)

structure base_two (α : Type*) := (two : ℕ)

@[ancestor base_one base_two]
structure bar extends base_one, base_two α
```

The list of ancestors should be in the order they appear in the `extends` clause, and should
contain only the names of the ancestor structures, without any arguments.
