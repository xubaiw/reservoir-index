# Documentation commands

We generate html documentation from mathlib. It is convenient to collect lists of tactics, commands,
notes, etc. To facilitate this, we declare these documentation entries in the library
using special commands.

* `library_note` adds a note describing a certain feature or design decision. These can be
  referenced in doc strings with the text `note [name of note]`.
* `add_tactic_doc` adds an entry documenting an interactive tactic, command, hole command, or
  attribute.

Since these commands are used in files imported by `tactic.core`, this file has no imports.

## Implementation details

`library_note note_id note_msg` creates a declaration `` `library_note.i `` for some `i`.
This declaration is a pair of strings `note_id` and `note_msg`, and it gets tagged with the
`library_note` attribute.

Similarly, `add_tactic_doc` creates a declaration `` `tactic_doc.i `` that stores the provided
information.

/--

-/
add_tactic_doc
{ name := "display name of the tactic",
  category := cat,
  decl_names := [`dcl_1, `dcl_2],
  tags := ["tag_1", "tag_2"] }
```

The argument to `add_tactic_doc` is a structure of type `tactic_doc_entry`.
* `name` refers to the display name of the tactic; it is used as the header of the doc entry.
* `cat` refers to the category of doc entry.
  Options: `doc_category.tactic`, `doc_category.cmd`, `doc_category.hole_cmd`, `doc_category.attr`
* `decl_names` is a list of the declarations associated with this doc. For instance,
  the entry for `linarith` would set ``decl_names := [`tactic.interactive.linarith]``.
  Some entries may cover multiple declarations.
  It is only necessary to list the interactive versions of tactics.
* `tags` is an optional list of strings used to categorize entries.
* The doc string is the body of the entry. It can be formatted with markdown.
  What you are reading now is the description of `add_tactic_doc`.

If only one related declaration is listed in `decl_names` and if this
invocation of `add_tactic_doc` does not have a doc string, the doc string of
that declaration will become the body of the tactic doc entry. If there are
multiple declarations, you can select the one to be used by passing a name to
the `inherit_description_from` field.

If you prefer a tactic to have a doc string that is different then the doc entry,
you should write the doc entry as a doc string for the `add_tactic_doc` invocation.

Note that providing a badly formed `tactic_doc_entry` to the command can result in strange error
messages.

/-- At various places in mathlib, we leave implementation notes that are referenced from many other
files. To keep track of these notes, we use the command `library_note`. This makes it easy to
retrieve a list of all notes, e.g. for documentation output.

These notes can be referenced in mathlib with the syntax `Note [note id]`.
Often, these references will be made in code comments (`--`) that won't be displayed in docs.
If such a reference is made in a doc string or module doc, it will be linked to the corresponding
note in the doc display.

Syntax:
```
/--
note message
-/
library_note "note id"
```

An example from `meta.expr`:

```
/--
Some declarations work with open expressions, i.e. an expr that has free variables.
Terms will free variables are not well-typed, and one should not use them in tactics like
`infer_type` or `unify`. You can still do syntactic analysis/manipulation on them.
The reason for working with open types is for performance: instantiating variables requires
iterating through the expression. In one performance test `pi_binders` was more than 6x
quicker than `mk_local_pis` (when applied to the type of all imported declarations 100x).
-/
library_note "open expressions"

This note can be referenced near a usage of `pi_binders`:


```

def f := pi_binders ...

/-- The congruence closure tactic `cc` tries to solve the goal by chaining
equalities from context and applying congruence (i.e. if `a = b`, then `f a = f b`).
It is a finishing tactic, i.e. it is meant to close
the current goal, not to make some inconclusive progress.
A mostly trivial example would be:

```lean
example (a b c : ℕ) (f : ℕ → ℕ) (h: a = b) (h' : b = c) : f a = f c := by cc
```

As an example requiring some thinking to do by hand, consider:

```lean
example (f : ℕ → ℕ) (x : ℕ)
  (H1 : f (f (f x)) = x) (H2 : f (f (f (f (f x)))) = x) :
  f x = x :=
by cc
```

The tactic works by building an equality matching graph. It's a graph where
the vertices are terms and they are linked by edges if they are known to
be equal. Once you've added all the equalities in your context, you take
the transitive closure of the graph and, for each connected component
(i.e. equivalence class) you can elect a term that will represent the
whole class and store proofs that the other elements are equal to it.
You then take the transitive closure of these equalities under the
congruence lemmas.

The `cc` implementation in Lean does a few more tricks: for example it
derives `a=b` from `nat.succ a = nat.succ b`, and `nat.succ a !=
nat.zero` for any `a`.

* The starting reference point is Nelson, Oppen, [Fast decision procedures based on congruence
closure](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~bec/courses/csci5535-s09/reading/nelson-oppen-congruence.pdf),
Journal of the ACM (1980)

* The congruence lemmas for dependent type theory as used in Lean are described in
[Congruence closure in intensional type theory](https://leanprover.github.io/papers/congr.pdf)
(de Moura, Selsam IJCAR 2016).

/-- `conv {...}` allows the user to perform targeted rewriting on a goal or hypothesis,
by focusing on particular subexpressions.

See <https://leanprover-community.github.io/extras/conv.html> for more details.

Inside `conv` blocks, mathlib currently additionally provides
* `erw`,
* `ring`, `ring2` and `ring_exp`,
* `norm_num`,
* `norm_cast`,
* `apply_congr`, and
* `conv` (within another `conv`).

`apply_congr` applies congruence lemmas to step further inside expressions,
and sometimes gives between results than the automatically generated
congruence lemmas used by `congr`.

Using `conv` inside a `conv` block allows the user to return to the previous
state of the outer `conv` block after it is finished. Thus you can continue
editing an expression without having to start a new `conv` block and re-scoping
everything. For example:
```lean
example (a b c d : ℕ) (h₁ : b = c) (h₂ : a + c = a + d) : a + b = a + d :=
by conv
{ to_lhs,
  conv
  { congr, skip,
    rw h₁ },
  rw h₂, }
```
Without `conv`, the above example would need to be proved using two successive
`conv` blocks, each beginning with `to_lhs`.

Also, as a shorthand, `conv_lhs` and `conv_rhs` are provided, so that
```lean
example : 0 + 0 = 0 :=
begin
  conv_lhs { simp }
end
```
just means
```lean
example : 0 + 0 = 0 :=
begin
  conv { to_lhs, simp }
end
```
and likewise for `to_rhs`.
