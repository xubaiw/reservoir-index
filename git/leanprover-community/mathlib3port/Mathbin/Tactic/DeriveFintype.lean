# Derive handler for `fintype` instances

This file introduces a derive handler to automatically generate `fintype`
instances for structures and inductives.

## Implementation notes

To construct a fintype instance, we need 3 things:

  1. A list `l` of elements
  2. A proof that `l` has no duplicates
  3. A proof that every element in the type is in `l`

Now fintype is defined as a finset which enumerates all elements, so steps (1) and (2) are
bundled together. It is possible to use finset operations that remove duplicates to avoid the need
to prove (2), but this adds unnecessary functions to the constructed term, which makes it more
expensive to compute the list, and it also adds a dependence on decidable equality for the type,
which we want to avoid.

Because we will rely on fintype instances for constructor arguments, we can't actually build a list
directly, so (1) and (2) are necessarily somewhat intertwined. The inductive types we will be
proving instances for look something like this:

```
@[derive fintype]
inductive foo
| zero : foo
| one : bool → foo
| two : ∀ x : fin 3, bar x → foo
```

The list of elements that we generate is
```
{foo.zero}
∪ (finset.univ : bool).map (λ b, finset.one b)
∪ (finset.univ : Σ' x : fin 3, bar x).map (λ ⟨x, y⟩, finset.two x y)
```
except that instead of `∪`, that is `finset.union`, we use `finset.disj_union` which doesn't
require any deduplication, but does require a proof that the two parts of the union are disjoint.
We use `finset.cons` to append singletons like `foo.zero`.

The proofs of disjointness would be somewhat expensive since there are quadratically many of them,
so instead we use a "discriminant" function. Essentially, we define
```
def foo.enum : foo → ℕ
| foo.zero := 0
| (foo.one _) := 1
| (foo.two _ _) := 2
```
and now the existence of this function implies that foo.zero is not foo.two and so on because they
map to different natural numbers. We can prove that sets of natural numbers are mutually disjoint
more easily because they have a linear order: `0 < 1 < 2` so `0 ≠ 2`.

To package this argument up, we define `finset_above foo foo.enum n` to be a finset `s` together
with a proof that all elements `a ∈ s` have `n ≤ enum a`. Now we only have to prove that
`enum foo.zero = 0`, `enum (foo.one _) = 1`, etc. (linearly many proofs, all `rfl`) in order to
prove that all variants are mutually distinct.

We mirror the `finset.cons` and `finset.disj_union` functions into `finset_above.cons` and
`finset_above.union`, and this forms the main part of the finset construction.

This only handles distinguishing variants of a finset. Now we must enumerate the elements of a
variant, for example `{foo.one ff, foo.one tt}`, while at the same time proving that all these
elements have discriminant `1` in this case. To do that, we use the `finset_in` type, which
is a finset satisfying a property `P`, here `λ a, foo.enum a = 1`.

We could use `finset.bind` many times to construct the finset but it turns out to be somewhat
complicated to get good side goals for a naturally nodup version of `finset.bind` in the same way
as we did with `finset.cons` and `finset.union`. Instead, we tuple up all arguments into one type,
leveraging the `fintype` instance on `psigma`, and then define a map from this type to the
inductive type that untuples them and applies the constructor. The injectivity property of the
constructor ensures that this function is injective, so we can use `finset.map` to apply it. This
is the content of the constructor `finset_in.mk`.

That completes the proofs of (1) and (2). To prove (3), we perform one case analysis over the
inductive type, proving theorems like
```
foo.one a ∈ {foo.zero}
  ∪ (finset.univ : bool).map (λ b, finset.one b)
  ∪ (finset.univ : Σ' x : fin 3, bar x).map (λ ⟨x, y⟩, finset.two x y)
```
by seeking to the relevant disjunct and then supplying the constructor arguments. This part of the
proof is quadratic, but quite simple. (We could do it in `O(n log n)` if we used a balanced tree
for the unions.)

The tactics perform the following parts of this proof scheme:
* `mk_sigma` constructs the type `Γ` in `finset_in.mk`
* `mk_sigma_elim` constructs the function `f` in `finset_in.mk`
* `mk_sigma_elim_inj` proves that `f` is injective
* `mk_sigma_elim_eq` proves that `∀ a, enum (f a) = k`
* `mk_finset` constructs the finset `S = {foo.zero} ∪ ...` by recursion on the variants
* `mk_finset_total` constructs the proof `|- foo.zero ∈ S; |- foo.one a ∈ S; |- foo.two a b ∈ S`
  by recursion on the subgoals coming out of the initial `cases`
* `mk_fintype_instance` puts it all together to produce a proof of `fintype foo`.
  The construction of `foo.enum` is also done in this function.
