# Recursive cases (`rcases`) tactic and related tactics

`rcases` is a tactic that will perform `cases` recursively, according to a pattern. It is used to
destructure hypotheses or expressions composed of inductive types like `h1 : a ∧ b ∧ c ∨ d` or
`h2 : ∃ x y, trans_rel R x y`. Usual usage might be `rcases h1 with ⟨ha, hb, hc⟩ | hd` or
`rcases h2 with ⟨x, y, _ | ⟨z, hxz, hzy⟩⟩` for these examples.

Each element of an `rcases` pattern is matched against a particular local hypothesis (most of which
are generated during the execution of `rcases` and represent individual elements destructured from
the input expression). An `rcases` pattern has the following grammar:

* A name like `x`, which names the active hypothesis as `x`.
* A blank `_`, which does nothing (letting the automatic naming system used by `cases` name the
  hypothesis).
* A hyphen `-`, which clears the active hypothesis and any dependents.
* The keyword `rfl`, which expects the hypothesis to be `h : a = b`, and calls `subst` on the
  hypothesis (which has the effect of replacing `b` with `a` everywhere or vice versa).
* A type ascription `p : ty`, which sets the type of the hypothesis to `ty` and then matches it
  against `p`. (Of course, `ty` must unify with the actual type of `h` for this to work.)
* A tuple pattern `⟨p1, p2, p3⟩`, which matches a constructor with many arguments, or a series
  of nested conjunctions or existentials. For example if the active hypothesis is `a ∧ b ∧ c`,
  then the conjunction will be destructured, and `p1` will be matched against `a`, `p2` against `b`
  and so on.
* An alteration pattern `p1 | p2 | p3`, which matches an inductive type with multiple constructors,
  or a nested disjunction like `a ∨ b ∨ c`.

The patterns are fairly liberal about the exact shape of the constructors, and will insert
additional alternation branches and tuple arguments if there are not enough arguments provided, and
reuse the tail for further matches if there are too many arguments provided to alternation and
tuple patterns.

This file also contains the `obtain` and `rintro` tactics, which use the same syntax of `rcases`
patterns but with a slightly different use case:

* `rintro` (or `rintros`) is used like `rintro x ⟨y, z⟩` and is the same as `intros` followed by
  `rcases` on the newly introduced arguments.
* `obtain` is the same as `rcases` but with a syntax styled after `have` rather than `cases`.
  `obtain ⟨hx, hy⟩ | hz := foo` is equivalent to `rcases foo with ⟨hx, hy⟩ | hz`. Unlike `rcases`,
  `obtain` also allows one to omit `:= foo`, although a type must be provided in this case,
  as in `obtain ⟨hx, hy⟩ | hz : a ∧ b ∨ c`, in which case it produces a subgoal for proving
  `a ∧ b ∨ c` in addition to the subgoals `hx : a, hy : b |- goal` and `hz : c |- goal`.

These synonyms for `list` are used to clarify the meanings of the many
usages of lists in this module.

- `listΣ` is used where a list represents a disjunction, such as the
  list of possible constructors of an inductive type.

- `listΠ` is used where a list represents a conjunction, such as the
  list of arguments of an individual constructor.

These are merely type synonyms, and so are not checked for consistency
by the compiler.

The `def`/`local notation` combination makes Lean retain these
annotations in reported types.

/-- An `rcases` pattern can be one of the following, in a nested combination:

* A name like `foo`
* The special keyword `rfl` (for pattern matching on equality using `subst`)
* A hyphen `-`, which clears the active hypothesis and any dependents.
* A type ascription like `pat : ty` (parentheses are optional)
* A tuple constructor like `⟨p1, p2, p3⟩`
* An alternation / variant pattern `p1 | p2 | p3`

Parentheses can be used for grouping; alternation is higher precedence than type ascription, so
`p1 | p2 | p3 : ty` means `(p1 | p2 | p3) : ty`.

N-ary alternations are treated as a group, so `p1 | p2 | p3` is not the same as `p1 | (p2 | p3)`,
and similarly for tuples. However, note that an n-ary alternation or tuple can match an n-ary
conjunction or disjunction, because if the number of patterns exceeds the number of constructors in
the type being destructed, the extra patterns will match on the last element, meaning that
`p1 | p2 | p3` will act like `p1 | (p2 | p3)` when matching `a1 ∨ a2 ∨ a3`. If matching against a
type with 3 constructors,  `p1 | (p2 | p3)` will act like `p1 | (p2 | p3) | _` instead.

/-- `rcases` is a tactic that will perform `cases` recursively, according to a pattern. It is used to
destructure hypotheses or expressions composed of inductive types like `h1 : a ∧ b ∧ c ∨ d` or
`h2 : ∃ x y, trans_rel R x y`. Usual usage might be `rcases h1 with ⟨ha, hb, hc⟩ | hd` or
`rcases h2 with ⟨x, y, _ | ⟨z, hxz, hzy⟩⟩` for these examples.

Each element of an `rcases` pattern is matched against a particular local hypothesis (most of which
are generated during the execution of `rcases` and represent individual elements destructured from
the input expression). An `rcases` pattern has the following grammar:

* A name like `x`, which names the active hypothesis as `x`.
* A blank `_`, which does nothing (letting the automatic naming system used by `cases` name the
  hypothesis).
* A hyphen `-`, which clears the active hypothesis and any dependents.
* The keyword `rfl`, which expects the hypothesis to be `h : a = b`, and calls `subst` on the
  hypothesis (which has the effect of replacing `b` with `a` everywhere or vice versa).
* A type ascription `p : ty`, which sets the type of the hypothesis to `ty` and then matches it
  against `p`. (Of course, `ty` must unify with the actual type of `h` for this to work.)
* A tuple pattern `⟨p1, p2, p3⟩`, which matches a constructor with many arguments, or a series
  of nested conjunctions or existentials. For example if the active hypothesis is `a ∧ b ∧ c`,
  then the conjunction will be destructured, and `p1` will be matched against `a`, `p2` against `b`
  and so on.
* An alteration pattern `p1 | p2 | p3`, which matches an inductive type with multiple constructors,
  or a nested disjunction like `a ∨ b ∨ c`.

A pattern like `⟨a, b, c⟩ | ⟨d, e⟩` will do a split over the inductive datatype,
naming the first three parameters of the first constructor as `a,b,c` and the
first two of the second constructor `d,e`. If the list is not as long as the
number of arguments to the constructor or the number of constructors, the
remaining variables will be automatically named. If there are nested brackets
such as `⟨⟨a⟩, b | c⟩ | d` then these will cause more case splits as necessary.
If there are too many arguments, such as `⟨a, b, c⟩` for splitting on
`∃ x, ∃ y, p x`, then it will be treated as `⟨a, ⟨b, c⟩⟩`, splitting the last
parameter as necessary.

`rcases` also has special support for quotient types: quotient induction into Prop works like
matching on the constructor `quot.mk`.

`rcases h : e with PAT` will do the same as `rcases e with PAT` with the exception that an
assumption `h : e = PAT` will be added to the context.

`rcases? e` will perform case splits on `e` in the same way as `rcases e`,
but rather than accepting a pattern, it does a maximal cases and prints the
pattern that would produce this case splitting. The default maximum depth is 5,
but this can be modified with `rcases? e : n`.

/-- The `rintro` tactic is a combination of the `intros` tactic with `rcases` to
allow for destructuring patterns while introducing variables. See `rcases` for
a description of supported patterns. For example, `rintro (a | ⟨b, c⟩) ⟨d, e⟩`
will introduce two variables, and then do case splits on both of them producing
two subgoals, one with variables `a d e` and the other with `b c d e`.

`rintro`, unlike `rcases`, also supports the form `(x y : ty)` for introducing
and type-ascripting multiple variables at once, similar to binders.

`rintro?` will introduce and case split on variables in the same way as
`rintro`, but will also print the `rintro` invocation that would have the same
result. Like `rcases?`, `rintro? : n` allows for modifying the
depth of splitting; the default is 5.

`rintros` is an alias for `rintro`.

/-- The `obtain` tactic is a combination of `have` and `rcases`. See `rcases` for
a description of supported patterns.

```lean
obtain ⟨patt⟩ : type,

is equivalent to
```lean
have h : type,

rcases h with ⟨patt⟩

The syntax `obtain ⟨patt⟩ : type := proof` is also supported.

If `⟨patt⟩` is omitted, `rcases` will try to infer the pattern.

If `type` is omitted, `:= proof` is required.
