# Various linters

This file defines several small linters:
  - `ge_or_gt` checks that `>` and `≥` do not occur in the statement of theorems.
  - `dup_namespace` checks that no declaration has a duplicated namespace such as `list.list.monad`.
  - `unused_arguments` checks that definitions and theorems do not have unused arguments.
  - `doc_blame` checks that every definition has a documentation string.
  - `doc_blame_thm` checks that every theorem has a documentation string (not enabled by default).
  - `def_lemma` checks that a declaration is a lemma iff its type is a proposition.
  - `check_type` checks that the statement of a declaration is well-typed.
  - `check_univs` checks that there are no bad `max u v` universe levels.
  - `syn_taut` checks that declarations are not syntactic tautologies.
  - `unused_haves_suffices` checks that declarations produced via term mode do not have
    ineffectual `have` or `suffices` statements

## Linter against use of `>`/`≥`

  [`gt, `ge]

-- ././Mathport/Syntax/Translate/Basic.lean:210:40: warning: unsupported option eqn_compiler.max_steps
set_option eqn_compiler.max_steps 20000

/-- Checks whether `≥` and `>` occurs in an illegal way in the expression.
  The main ways we legally use these orderings are:
  - `f (≥)`
  - `∃ x ≥ t, b`. This corresponds to the expression
    `@Exists α (fun (x : α), (@Exists (x > t) (λ (H : x > t), b)))`
  This function returns `tt` when it finds `ge`/`gt`, except in the following patterns
  (which are the same for `gt`):
  - `f (@ge _ _)`
  - `f (&0 ≥ y) (λ x : t, b)`
  - `λ H : &0 ≥ t, b`
  Here `&0` is the 0-th de Bruijn variable.

remaining non-Pi expression;
2. Check if the remaining non-Pi expression is an iff, already obtaining the respective left and
right expressions if this is the case. Returns `none` otherwise;
3. Filter the explicit variables that appear on the left *and* right side of the iff;
4. If no variable satisfies the condition above, return `none`;
5. Return a message mentioning the variables that do, otherwise.
