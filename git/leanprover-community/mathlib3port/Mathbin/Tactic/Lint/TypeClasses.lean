# Linters about type classes

This file defines several linters checking the correct usage of type classes
and the appropriate definition of instances:

 * `instance_priority` ensures that blanket instances have low priority.
 * `has_inhabited_instances` checks that every type has an `inhabited` instance.
 * `impossible_instance` checks that there are no instances which can never apply.
 * `incorrect_type_class_argument` checks that only type classes are used in
   instance-implicit arguments.
 * `dangerous_instance` checks for instances that generate subproblems with metavariables.
 * `fails_quickly` checks that type class resolution finishes quickly.
 * `class_structure` checks that every `class` is a structure, i.e. `@[class] def` is forbidden.
 * `has_coe_variable` checks that there is no instance of type `has_coe α t`.
 * `inhabited_nonempty` checks whether `[inhabited α]` arguments could be generalized
   to `[nonempty α]`.
 * `decidable_classical` checks propositions for `[decidable_... p]` hypotheses that are not used
   in the statement, and could thus be removed by using `classical` in the proof.
 * `linter.has_coe_to_fun` checks whether necessary `has_coe_to_fun` instances are declared.
 * `linter.check_reducibility` checks whether non-instances with a class as type are reducible.

library_note "implicit instance arguments"/--
There are places where typeclass arguments are specified with implicit `{}` brackets instead of
the usual `[]` brackets. This is done when the instances can be inferred because they are implicit
arguments to the type of one of the other arguments. When they can be inferred from these other
arguments,  it is faster to use this method than to use type class inference.

For example, when writing lemmas about `(f : α →+* β)`, it is faster to specify the fact that `α`
and `β` are `semiring`s as `{rα : semiring α} {rβ : semiring β}` rather than the usual
`[semiring α] [semiring β]`.
-/


library_note "lower instance priority"/--
Certain instances always apply during type-class resolution. For example, the instance
`add_comm_group.to_add_group {α} [add_comm_group α] : add_group α` applies to all type-class
resolution problems of the form `add_group _`, and type-class inference will then do an
exhaustive search to find a commutative group. These instances take a long time to fail.
Other instances will only apply if the goal has a certain shape. For example
`int.add_group : add_group ℤ` or
`add_group.prod {α β} [add_group α] [add_group β] : add_group (α × β)`. Usually these instances
will fail quickly, and when they apply, they are almost the desired instance.
For this reason, we want the instances of the second type (that only apply in specific cases) to
always have higher priority than the instances of the first type (that always apply).
See also #1561.

Therefore, if we create an instance that always applies, we set the priority of these instances to
100 (or something similar, which is below the default value of 1000).
