# `suggest` and `library_search`

`suggest` and `library_search` are a pair of tactics for applying lemmas from the library to the
current goal.

* `suggest` prints a list of `exact ...` or `refine ...` statements, which may produce new goals
* `library_search` prints a single `exact ...` which closes the goal, or fails

-- TODO this is a hack; if you suspect more cases here would help, please report them
/-- Map a name (typically a head symbol) to a "canonical" definitional synonym.
Given a name `n`, we want a name `n'` such that a sufficiently applied
expression with head symbol `n` is always definitionally equal to an expression
with head symbol `n'`.
Thus, we can search through all lemmas with a result type of `n'`
to solve a goal with head symbol `n`.

For example, `>` is mapped to `<` because `a > b` is definitionally equal to `b < a`,
and `not` is mapped to `false` because `¬ a` is definitionally equal to `p → false`
The default is that the original argument is returned, so `<` is just mapped to `<`.

`normalize_synonym` is called for every lemma in the library, so it needs to be fast.

-- We may want to tweak this further?
/-- Compute the head symbol of an expression, then normalise synonyms.

This is only used when analysing the goal, so it is okay to do more expensive analysis here.

/-- `suggest` tries to apply suitable theorems/defs from the library, and generates
a list of `exact ...` or `refine ...` scripts that could be used at this step.
It leaves the tactic state unchanged. It is intended as a complement of the search
function in your editor, the `#find` tactic, and `library_search`.

`suggest` takes an optional natural number `num` as input and returns the first `num`
(or less, if all possibilities are exhausted) possibilities ordered by length of lemma names.
The default for `num` is `50`.
For performance reasons `suggest` uses monadic lazy lists (`mllist`). This means that
`suggest` might miss some results if `num` is not large enough. However, because
`suggest` uses monadic lazy lists, smaller values of `num` run faster than larger values.

You can add additional lemmas to be used along with local hypotheses
after the application of a library lemma,
using the same syntax as for `solve_by_elim`, e.g.
```
example {a b c d: nat} (h₁ : a < c) (h₂ : b < d) : max (c + d) (a + b) = (c + d) :=
begin
  suggest [add_lt_add], -- Says: `Try this: exact max_eq_left_of_lt (add_lt_add h₁ h₂)`
end

/-- `suggest` lists possible usages of the `refine` tactic and leaves the tactic state unchanged.

/-- `library_search` is a tactic to identify existing lemmas in the library. It tries to close the
current goal by applying a lemma from the library, then discharging any new goals using
`solve_by_elim`.

If it succeeds, it prints a trace message `exact ...` which can replace the invocation
of `library_search`.

Typical usage is:
```lean
example (n m k : ℕ) : n * (m - k) = n * m - n * k :=
by library_search -- Try this: exact mul_tsub n m k
```

`library_search using h₁ h₂` will only show solutions
that make use of the local hypotheses `h₁` and `h₂`.

By default `library_search` only unfolds `reducible` definitions
when attempting to match lemmas against the goal.
Previously, it would unfold most definitions, sometimes giving surprising answers, or slow answers.
The old behaviour is still available via `library_search!`.

You can add additional lemmas to be used along with local hypotheses
after the application of a library lemma,
using the same syntax as for `solve_by_elim`, e.g.
