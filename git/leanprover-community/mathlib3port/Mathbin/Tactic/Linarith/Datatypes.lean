# Datatypes for `linarith`

Some of the data structures here are used in multiple parts of the tactic.
We split them into their own file.

This file also contains a few convenient auxiliary functions.

/-! ### Linear expressions -/


/-- A linear expression is a list of pairs of variable indices and coefficients,
representing the sum of the products of each coefficient with its corresponding variable.

Some functions on `linexp` assume that `n : ℕ` occurs at most once as the first element of a pair,
and that the list is sorted in decreasing order of the first argument.
This is not enforced by the type but the operations here preserve it.
-/
@[reducible]
def Linexp : Type :=
  List (ℕ × ℤ)

namespace Linexp

/-- Add two `linexp`s together componentwise.
Preserves sorting and uniqueness of the first argument.
-/

  | a, [] => a
  | a@(n1, z1) :: t1, b@(n2, z2) :: t2 =>
    if n1 < n2 then b :: add (a :: t1) t2

      if n2 < n1 then a :: add t1 (b :: t2)
      else
        let sum := z1 + z2
        if Sum = 0 then add t1 t2 else (n1, Sum) :: add t1 t2

/-- `l.scale c` scales the values in `l` by `c` without modifying the order or keys. -/
def scale (c : ℤ) (l : Linexp) : Linexp :=
  if c = 0 then [] else if c = 1 then l else l.map fun ⟨n, z⟩ => (n, z * c)

/-- `l.get n` returns the value in `l` associated with key `n`, if it exists, and `none` otherwise.
This function assumes that `l` is sorted in decreasing order of the first argument,
that is, it will return `none` as soon as it finds a key smaller than `n`.
-/
def get (n : ℕ) : Linexp → Option ℤ
  | [] => none
  | (a, b) :: t => if a < n then none else if a = n then some b else get t

/-- `l.contains n` is true iff `n` is the first element of a pair in `l`.
-/
def contains (n : ℕ) : Linexp → Bool :=
  Option.isSome ∘ get n

/-- `l.zfind n` returns the value associated with key `n` if there is one, and 0 otherwise.
-/
def zfind (n : ℕ) (l : Linexp) : ℤ :=
  match l.get n with
  | none => 0
  | some v => v

/-- `l.vars` returns the list of variables that occur in `l`. -/
def vars (l : Linexp) : List ℕ :=
  l.map Prod.fst

/-- Defines a lex ordering on `linexp`. This function is performance critical.

terms. -/

namespace Ineq

/-- `max R1 R2` computes the strength of the sum of two inequalities. If `t1 R1 0` and `t2 R2 0`,
then `t1 + t2 (max R1 R2) 0`.

/-! ### Comparisons with 0 -/


/-- The main datatype for FM elimination.
Variables are represented by natural numbers, each of which has an integer coefficient.
Index 0 is reserved for constants, i.e. `coeffs.find 0` is the coefficient of 1.
The represented term is `coeffs.sum (λ ⟨k, v⟩, v * Var[k])`.
str determines the strength of the comparison -- is it < 0, ≤ 0, or = 0?
-/
structure Comp : Type where
  str : Ineq
  coeffs : Linexp
  deriving Inhabited

/-- `c.vars` returns the list of variables that appear in the linear expression contained in `c`. -/
def Comp.vars : Comp → List ℕ :=

/-- `comp.coeff_of c a` projects the coefficient of variable `a` out of `c`. -/

/-- `comp.scale c n` scales the coefficients of `c` by `n`. -/
def Comp.scale (c : Comp) (n : ℕ) : Comp :=
  { c with coeffs := c.coeffs.scale n }

/-- `comp.add c1 c2` adds the expressions represented by `c1` and `c2`.
The coefficient of variable `a` in `c1.add c2`
is the sum of the coefficients of `a` in `c1` and `c2`.
 -/
unsafe def comp.add (c1 c2 : Comp) : Comp :=
  ⟨c1.str.max c2.str, c1.coeffs.add c2.coeffs⟩

/-- `comp` has a lex order. First the `ineq`s are compared, then the `coeff`s. -/

    match str1.cmp str2 with
    | Ordering.lt => Ordering.lt
    | Ordering.gt => Ordering.gt
    | Ordering.eq => coeffs1.cmp coeffs2

/-- A `comp` represents a contradiction if its expression has no coefficients and its strength is <,
that is, it represents the fact `0 < 0`.

/-! ### Parsing into linear form -/


/-! ### Control -/


/-- A preprocessor transforms a proof of a proposition into a proof of a different propositon.
The return type is `list expr`, since some preprocessing steps may create multiple new hypotheses,
and some may remove a hypothesis from the list.
A "no-op" preprocessor should return its input as a singleton list.
-/
unsafe structure preprocessor : Type where
  Name : Stringₓ
  transform : expr → tactic (List expr)

/-- Some preprocessors need to examine the full list of hypotheses instead of working item by item.
As with `preprocessor`, the input to a `global_preprocessor` is replaced by, not added to, its
output.
-/
unsafe structure global_preprocessor : Type where
  Name : Stringₓ
  transform : List expr → tactic (List expr)

/-- Some preprocessors perform branching case splits. A `branch` is used to track one of these case
splits. The first component, an `expr`, is the goal corresponding to this branch of the split,
given as a metavariable. The `list expr` component is the list of hypotheses for `linarith`
in this branch. Every `expr` in this list should be type correct in the context of the associated
goal.
-/
unsafe def branch : Type :=
  expr × List expr

/-- Some preprocessors perform branching case splits.
A `global_branching_preprocessor` produces a list of branches to run.
Each branch is independent, so hypotheses that appear in multiple branches should be duplicated.
The preprocessor is responsible for making sure that each branch contains the correct goal
metavariable.
-/
unsafe structure global_branching_preprocessor : Type where
  Name : Stringₓ
  transform : List expr → tactic (List branch)

/-- A `preprocessor` lifts to a `global_preprocessor` by folding it over the input list.
-/
unsafe def preprocessor.globalize (pp : preprocessor) : global_preprocessor where
  Name := pp.Name
  transform :=
    List.mfoldl
      (fun ret e => do
        let l' ← pp.transform e
        return (l' ++ ret))
      []

/-- A `global_preprocessor` lifts to a `global_branching_preprocessor` by producing only one branch.
-/
unsafe def global_preprocessor.branching (pp : global_preprocessor) : global_branching_preprocessor where
  Name := pp.Name
  transform := fun l => do
    let g ← tactic.get_goal
    singleton <$> Prod.mk g <$> pp l

/-- `process pp l` runs `pp.transform` on `l` and returns the result,
tracing the result if `trace.linarith` is on.

    tactic (List branch) := do

  ⟨global_preprocessor.branching ∘ preprocessor.globalize⟩

unsafe instance global_preprocessor_to_gb_preprocessor : Coe global_preprocessor global_branching_preprocessor :=
  ⟨global_preprocessor.branching⟩

/-- A `certificate_oracle` is a function `produce_certificate : list comp → ℕ → tactic (rb_map ℕ ℕ)`.
`produce_certificate hyps max_var` tries to derive a contradiction from the comparisons in `hyps`
by eliminating all variables ≤ `max_var`.
If successful, it returns a map `coeff : ℕ → ℕ` as a certificate.
This map represents that we can find a contradiction by taking the sum  `∑ (coeff i) * hyps[i]`.

The default `certificate_oracle` used by `linarith` is
`linarith.fourier_motzkin.produce_certificate`.
-/

`semireducible` if `reduce_semi` is true. In this case, it also sets the discharger to `ring!`,
since this is typically needed when using stronger unification.

These functions are used by multiple modules, so we put them here for accessibility.

/-- `get_rel_sides e` returns the left and right hand sides of `e` if `e` is a comparison,
and fails otherwise.
This function is more naturally in the `option` monad, but it is convenient to put in `tactic`
for compositionality.

  | _ => tactic.failed

/-- `parse_into_comp_and_expr e` checks if `e` is of the form `t < 0`, `t ≤ 0`, or `t = 0`.
If it is, it returns the comparison along with `t`.

/-- `mk_single_comp_zero_pf c h` assumes that `h` is a proof of `t R 0`.
It produces a pair `(R', h')`, where `h'` is a proof of `c*t R' 0`.
Typically `R` and `R'` will be the same, except when `c = 0`, in which case `R'` is `=`.
If `c = 1`, `h'` is the same as `h` -- specifically, it does *not* change the type to `1*t R 0`.
