# The Following Are Equivalent (TFAE)

This file provides the tactics `tfae_have` and `tfae_finish` for proving the pairwise equivalence of
propositions in a set using various implications between them.

also provide a label for the assertion, as with `have`: `tfae_have h : i ↔ j`.

/-- The `tfae` tactic suite is a set of tactics that help with proving that certain
propositions are equivalent.
In `data/list/basic.lean` there is a section devoted to propositions of the
form
```lean
tfae [p1, p2, ..., pn]
```
where `p1`, `p2`, through, `pn` are terms of type `Prop`.
This proposition asserts that all the `pi` are pairwise equivalent.
There are results that allow to extract the equivalence
of two propositions `pi` and `pj`.

To prove a goal of the form `tfae [p1, p2, ..., pn]`, there are two
tactics.  The first tactic is `tfae_have`.  As an argument it takes an
expression of the form `i arrow j`, where `i` and `j` are two positive
natural numbers, and `arrow` is an arrow such as `→`, `->`, `←`, `<-`,
`↔`, or `<->`.  The tactic `tfae_have : i arrow j` sets up a subgoal in
which the user has to prove the equivalence (or implication) of `pi` and `pj`.

The remaining tactic, `tfae_finish`, is a finishing tactic. It
collects all implications and equivalences from the local context and
computes their transitive closure to close the
main goal.

`tfae_have` and `tfae_finish` can be used together in a proof as
follows:

```lean
example (a b c d : Prop) : tfae [a,b,c,d] :=
begin
  tfae_have : 3 → 1,
  { /- prove c → a -/ },
  tfae_have : 2 → 3,
  { /- prove b → c -/ },
  tfae_have : 2 ← 1,
  { /- prove a → b -/ },
  tfae_have : 4 ↔ 2,
  { /- prove d ↔ b -/ },
    -- a b c d : Prop,
    -- tfae_3_to_1 : c → a,
    -- tfae_2_to_3 : b → c,
    -- tfae_1_to_2 : a → b,
    -- tfae_4_iff_2 : d ↔ b
    -- ⊢ tfae [a, b, c, d]
  tfae_finish,
end
```
