# `ring_exp` tactic

A tactic for solving equations in commutative (semi)rings,
where the exponents can also contain variables.

More precisely, expressions of the following form are supported:
- constants (non-negative integers)
- variables
- coefficients (any rational number, embedded into the (semi)ring)
- addition of expressions
- multiplication of expressions
- exponentiation of expressions (the exponent must have type `ℕ`)
- subtraction and negation of expressions (if the base is a full ring)

The motivating example is proving `2 * 2^n * b = b * 2^(n+1)`,
something that the `ring` tactic cannot do, but `ring_exp` can.

## Implementation notes

The basic approach to prove equalities is to normalise both sides and check for equality.
The normalisation is guided by building a value in the type `ex` at the meta level,
together with a proof (at the base level) that the original value is equal to
the normalised version.
The normalised version and normalisation proofs are also stored in the `ex` type.

The outline of the file:
- Define an inductive family of types `ex`, parametrised over `ex_type`,
  which can represent expressions with `+`, `*`, `^` and rational numerals.
  The parametrisation over `ex_type` ensures that associativity and distributivity are applied,
  by restricting which kinds of subexpressions appear as arguments to the various operators.
- Represent addition, multiplication and exponentiation in the `ex` type,
  thus allowing us to map expressions to `ex` (the `eval` function drives this).
  We apply associativity and distributivity of the operators here (helped by `ex_type`)
  and commutativity as well (by sorting the subterms; unfortunately not helped by anything).
  Any expression not of the above formats is treated as an atom (the same as a variable).

There are some details we glossed over which make the plan more complicated:
- The order on atoms is not initially obvious.
  We construct a list containing them in order of initial appearance in the expression,
  then use the index into the list as a key to order on.
- In the tactic, a normalized expression `ps : ex` lives in the meta-world,
  but the normalization proofs live in the real world.
  Thus, we cannot directly say `ps.orig = ps.pretty` anywhere,
  but we have to carefully construct the proof when we compute `ps`.
  This was a major source of bugs in development!
- For `pow`, the exponent must be a natural number, while the base can be any semiring `α`.
  We swap out operations for the base ring `α` with those for the exponent ring `ℕ`
  as soon as we deal with exponents.
  This is accomplished by the `in_exponent` function and is relatively painless since
  we work in a `reader` monad.
- The normalized form of an expression is the one that is useful for the tactic,
  but not as nice to read. To remedy this, the user-facing normalization calls `ex.simp`.

## Caveats and future work

Subtraction cancels out identical terms, but division does not.
That is: `a - a = 0 := by ring_exp` solves the goal,
but `a / a := 1 by ring_exp` doesn't.
Note that `0 / 0` is generally defined to be `0`,
so division cancelling out is not true in general.

Multiplication of powers can be simplified a little bit further:
`2 ^ n * 2 ^ n = 4 ^ n := by ring_exp` could be implemented
in a similar way that `2 * a + 2 * a = 4 * a := by ring_exp` already works.
This feature wasn't needed yet, so it's not implemented yet.

/-- The `atom` structure is used to represent atomic expressions:
those which `ring_exp` cannot parse any further.

For instance, `a + (a % b)` has `a` and `(a % b)` as atoms.
The `ring_exp_eq` tactic does not normalize the subexpressions in atoms,
but `ring_exp` does if `ring_exp_eq` was not sufficient.

Atoms in fact represent equivalence classes of expressions,
modulo definitional equality.
The field `index : ℕ` should be a unique number for each class,
while `value : expr` contains a representative of this class.
The function `resolve_atom` determines the appropriate atom
for a given expression.

### `expression` section

In this section, we define the `ex` type and its basic operations.

First, we introduce the supporting types `coeff`, `ex_type` and `ex_info`.
For understanding the code, it's easier to check out `ex` itself first,
then refer back to the supporting types.

The arithmetic operations on `ex` need additional definitions,
so they are defined in a later section.
-/


/-- Coefficients in the expression are stored in a wrapper structure,
allowing for easier modification of the data structures.
The modifications might be caching of the result of `expr.of_rat`,
or using a different meta representation of numerals.

  | Sum : ex_type
  | Prod : ex_type
  | exp : ex_type
  deriving DecidableEq, Inhabited

open ExType

/-- Each `ex` stores information for its normalization proof.

The `orig` expression is the expression that was passed to `eval`.

The `pretty` expression is the normalised form that the `ex` represents.
(I didn't call this something like `norm`, because there are already
too many things called `norm` in mathematics!)

The field `proof` contains an optional proof term of type `%%orig = %%pretty`.
The value `none` for the proof indicates that everything reduces to reflexivity.
(Which saves space in quite a lot of cases.)
-/
unsafe structure ex_info : Type where
  orig : expr
  pretty : expr
  Proof : Option expr

/-- The `ex` type is an abstract representation of an expression with `+`, `*` and `^`.
Those operators are mapped to the `sum`, `prod` and `exp` constructors respectively.

The `zero` constructor is the base case for `ex sum`, e.g. `1 + 2` is represented
by (something along the lines of) `sum 1 (sum 2 zero)`.

The `coeff` constructor is the base case for `ex prod`, and is used for numerals.
The code maintains the invariant that the coefficient is never `0`.

The `var` constructor is the base case for `ex exp`, and is used for atoms.

The `sum_b` constructor allows for addition in the base of an exponentiation;
it serves a similar purpose as the parentheses in `(a + b)^c`.
The code maintains the invariant that the argument to `sum_b` is not `zero`
or `sum _ zero`.

All of the constructors contain an `ex_info` field,
used to carry around (arguments to) proof terms.

While the `ex_type` parameter enforces some simplification invariants,
the following ones must be manually maintained at the risk of insufficient power:
- the argument to `coeff` must be nonzero (to ensure `0 = 0 * 1`)
- the argument to `sum_b` must be of the form `sum a (sum b bs)` (to ensure `(a + 0)^n = a^n`)
- normalisation proofs of subexpressions must be `refl ps.pretty`
- if we replace `sum` with `cons` and `zero` with `nil`, the resulting list is sorted
  according to the `lt` relation defined further down; similarly for `prod` and `coeff`
  (to ensure `a + b = b + a`).

The first two invariants could be encoded in a subtype of `ex`,
but aren't (yet) to spare some implementation burden.
The other invariants cannot be encoded because we need the `tactic` monad to check them.
(For example, the correct equality check of `expr` is `is_def_eq : expr → expr → tactic unit`.)

### `operations` section

This section defines the operations (on `ex`) that use tactics.
They live in the `ring_exp_m` monad,
which adds a cache and a list of encountered atoms to the `tactic` monad.

Throughout this section, we will be constructing proof terms.
The lemmas used in the construction are all defined over a commutative semiring α.

section Rewrite

/-! ### `rewrite` section

In this section we deal with rewriting terms to fit in the basic grammar of `eval`.
For example, `nat.succ n` is rewritten to `n + 1` before it is evaluated further.
-/


/-- Given a proof that the expressions `ps_o` and `ps'.orig` are equal,
show that `ps_o` and `ps'.pretty` are equal.

Useful to deal with aliases in `eval`. For instance, `nat.succ p` can be handled
as an alias of `p + 1` as follows:
```
| ps_o@`(nat.succ %%p_o) := do
  ps' ← eval `(%%p_o + 1),
  pf ← lift $ mk_app ``nat.succ_eq_add_one [p_o],
  rewrite ps_o ps' pf
```
-/
unsafe def rewrite (ps_o : expr) (ps' : ex Sum) (pf : expr) : ring_exp_m (ex Sum) := do
  let ps'_pf ← ps'.info.proof_term
  let pf ← lift <| mk_eq_trans pf ps'_pf
  pure <| ps' ps_o pf

end Rewrite

/-- Represents the way in which two products are equal except coefficient.

This type is used in the function `add_overlap`.
In order to deal with equations of the form `a * 2 + a = 3 * a`,
the `add` function will add up overlapping products,
turning `a * 2 + a` into `a * 3`.
We need to distinguish `a * 2 + a` from `a * 2 + b` in order to do this,
and the `overlap` type carries the information on how it overlaps.

The case `none` corresponds to non-overlapping products, e.g. `a * 2 + b`;
the case `nonzero` to overlapping products adding to non-zero, e.g. `a * 2 + a`
(the `ex prod` field will then look like `a * 3` with a proof that `a * 2 + a = a * 3`);
the case `zero` to overlapping products adding to zero, e.g. `a * 2 + a * -2`.
We distinguish those two cases because in the second, the whole product reduces to `0`.

A potential extension to the tactic would also do this for the base of exponents,
e.g. to show `2^n * 2^n = 4^n`.

### `wiring` section

This section deals with going from `expr` to `ex` and back.

The main attraction is `eval`, which uses `add`, `mul`, etc.
to calculate an `ex` from a given `expr`.
Other functions use `ex`es to produce `expr`s together with a proof,
or produce the context to run `ring_exp_m` from an `expr`.
