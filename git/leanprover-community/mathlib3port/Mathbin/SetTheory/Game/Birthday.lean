# Birthdays of games

The birthday of a game is an ordinal that represents at which "step" the game was constructed. We
define it recursively as the least ordinal larger than the birthdays of its left and right games. We
prove the basic properties about these.

# Main declarations

- `pgame.birthday`: The birthday of a pre-game.

# Todo

- Define the birthdays of `game`s and `surreal`s.
- Characterize the birthdays of basic arithmetical operations.
