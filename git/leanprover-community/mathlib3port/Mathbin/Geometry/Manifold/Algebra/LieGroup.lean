# Lie groups

A Lie group is a group that is also a smooth manifold, in which the group operations of
multiplication and inversion are smooth maps. Smoothness of the group multiplication means that
multiplication is a smooth mapping of the product manifold `G` √ó `G` into `G`.

Note that, since a manifold here is not second-countable and Hausdorff a Lie group here is not
guaranteed to be second-countable (even though it can be proved it is Hausdorff). Note also that Lie
groups here are not necessarily finite dimensional.

## Main definitions and statements

* `lie_add_group I G` : a Lie additive group where `G` is a manifold on the model with corners `I`.
* `lie_group I G`     : a Lie multiplicative group where `G` is a manifold on the model with
                        corners `I`.
* `normed_space_lie_add_group` : a normed vector space over a nontrivially normed field
                                 is an additive Lie group.

## Implementation notes

A priori, a Lie group here is a manifold with corners.

The definition of Lie group cannot require `I : model_with_corners ùïú E E` with the same space as the
model space and as the model vector space, as one might hope, beause in the product situation,
the model space is `model_prod E E'` and the model vector space is `E √ó E'`, which are not the same,
so the definition does not apply. Hence the definition should be more general, allowing
`I : model_with_corners ùïú E H`.
