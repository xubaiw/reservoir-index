# The category of bounded distributive lattices

This defines `BoundedDistribLattice`, the category of bounded distributive lattices.

Note that this category is sometimes called [`DistLat`](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/DistLat) when
being a lattice is understood to entail having a bottom and a top element.
