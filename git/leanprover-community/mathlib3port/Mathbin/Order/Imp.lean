# Implication and equivalence as operations on a boolean algebra

In this file we define `lattice.imp` (notation: `a ⇒ₒ b`) and `lattice.biimp` (notation: `a ⇔ₒ b`)
to be the implication and equivalence as operations on a boolean algebra. More precisely, we put
`a ⇒ₒ b = aᶜ ⊔ b` and `a ⇔ₒ b = (a ⇒ₒ b) ⊓ (b ⇒ₒ a)`. Equivalently, `a ⇒ₒ b = (a \ b)ᶜ` and
`a ⇔ₒ b = (a ∆ b)ᶜ`. For propositions these operations are equal to the usual implication and `iff`.
