# Type synonyms

This file provides two type synonyms for order theory:
* `order_dual α`: Type synonym of `α` to equip it with the dual order (`a ≤ b` becomes `b ≤ a`).
* `lex α`: Type synonym of `α` to equip it with its lexicographic order. The precise meaning depends
  on the type we take the lex of. Examples include `prod`, `sigma`, `list`, `finset`.

## Notation

`αᵒᵈ` is notation for `order_dual α`.

The general rule for notation of `lex` types is to append `ₗ` to the usual notation.

## Implementation notes

One should not abuse definitional equality between `α` and `αᵒᵈ`/`lex α`. Instead, explicit
coercions should be inserted:
* `order_dual`: `order_dual.to_dual : α → αᵒᵈ` and `order_dual.of_dual : αᵒᵈ → α`
* `lex`: `to_lex : α → lex α` and `of_lex : lex α → α`.

In fact, those are bundled as `equiv`s to put goals in the right syntactic form for rewriting with
the `equiv` API (`⇑to_lex a` where `⇑` is `coe_fn : (α ≃ lex α) → α → lex α`, instead of a bare
`to_lex a`).

## See also

This file is similar to `algebra.group.type_tags`.
