/-! # Subtypes of conditionally complete linear orders

In this file we give conditions on a subset of a conditionally complete linear order, to ensure that
the subtype is itself conditionally complete.

We check that an `ord_connected` set satisfies these conditions.

## TODO

Add appropriate instances for all `set.Ixx`. This requires a refactor that will allow different
default values for `Sup` and `Inf`.
