# Closure operators between preorders

We define (bundled) closure operators on a preorder as monotone (increasing), extensive
(inflationary) and idempotent functions.
We define closed elements for the operator as elements which are fixed by it.

Lower adjoints to a function between preorders `u : β → α` allow to generalise closure operators to
situations where the closure operator we are dealing with naturally decomposes as `u ∘ l` where `l`
is a worthy function to have on its own. Typical examples include
`l : set G → subgroup G := subgroup.closure`, `u : subgroup G → set G := coe`, where `G` is a group.
This shows there is a close connection between closure operators, lower adjoints and Galois
connections/insertions: every Galois connection induces a lower adjoint which itself induces a
closure operator by composition (see `galois_connection.lower_adjoint` and
`lower_adjoint.closure_operator`), and every closure operator on a partial order induces a Galois
insertion from the set of closed elements to the underlying type (see `closure_operator.gi`).

## Main definitions

* `closure_operator`: A closure operator is a monotone function `f : α → α` such that
  `∀ x, x ≤ f x` and `∀ x, f (f x) = f x`.
* `lower_adjoint`: A lower adjoint to `u : β → α` is a function `l : α → β` such that `l` and `u`
  form a Galois connection.

## Implementation details

Although `lower_adjoint` is technically a generalisation of `closure_operator` (by defining
`to_fun := id`), it is desirable to have both as otherwise `id`s would be carried all over the
place when using concrete closure operators such as `convex_hull`.

`lower_adjoint` really is a semibundled `structure` version of `galois_connection`.
