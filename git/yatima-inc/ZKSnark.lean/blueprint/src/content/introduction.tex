\chapter*{Introduction}\label{chap:intro}

In this blueprint we formalize the knowledge soundness proof for the BabySNARK protocol. 

The protocol is a toy example of a Zk SNARK protocol defined and implemented in the repository \href{https://github.com/initc3/babySNARK}. 

The outline of the proof used in this blueprint is a port of the work done by Bolton Bailey in Lean 3 found here \href{https://github.com/BoltonBailey/formal-snarks-project/}. 

We will eventually include proofs of knowledge soundness for other protocols as well, and proofs of completeness and zero knowledge.
