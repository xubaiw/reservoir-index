## Graph library for Lean 4

This is a graph library for the upcoming 4th version of Lean. Functions are documented in comments in the source code.

## Example use

To help you get started with using this library see [this](https://github.com/PeterKementzey/example-lean4-pkg-using-Graph) example project I made.

## Benchmarks

Some of the functionality has been benchmarked against Haskell implementations, mainly to compare the performance of the languages. You can find that [here](https://github.com/PeterKementzey/lean-graph-benchmarking).
